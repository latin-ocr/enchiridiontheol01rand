82 RIDLEY AGAINST

cuppe, by a figure called Metonymia, for that Christes
wordes meant, and so must nedes be taken, thow sayest
verye well. But I praye the by the waye here note two
thing-es, fyrst that this worde (ys) hath no such strength or
signification in the Lordes wordes to make or to signifie any
transubstantiacion: Secondly that in the Lordes wordes
wherby he instituted the sacramente of his bloude, he vseth
a figuratiue speache. Howe vaine then is it that some soe
earnestlye do saie, as it were an infallible rule, that in doc-
trine, and in thinstitution of the sacraments Christ vseth no
figures, but all his wordes arc to be streined to their proper
significations? when as here, what so euer thou saieste was
in the (zuppo, yet neither that, nor the cuppe it self was
(taking cuerie woorde in his proper signification) the newe
testament: But in vnderstanding that which was in the
cuppe, by the cup, that is a figuratiue spech. Yea and
also thou canste not verifie or truely saie of that (whether
thou saiste it was wine, or Christes bloude) to bee the new
testament, without a figure also: Thus in one sentence
spoken of Christe in the institution of the sacrament of his
bloude, the fygure muste helpe vs twise. So vntrue is it
that some doe write, that Christe vseth no figure in the doc-
trine of saith, nor in the institution of his sacramentes.
But some saie if we shall thus admitte figures in doctrine,
then shall all the articles of our faieth by figures and alle-
gories, shortlye be transformed and vnloused. I saie it is
like fault, and euen the same, to denie the figure where the
place soe requireth to be vnderstanded, as vainelye to make
it a figuratiue speche, whiche is to be vnderstanded in his
proper signification.

The rules wherby the speche is knowen when it is figu-
ratiue, and wherby it is none, S. Austine in his booke
called de doctrina Christiana, geueth diuerse learned les-
sons verie necessari to be knowne of the studente in Gods
worde. Of the whiche one I will reherse, which is this:
Yf (saieth he) the scripture doeth seame to commaund a
thinge whiche is wicked or vngodly: Or to forbidde a thing
that charitie doeth require, then knowe thou (saith he) that
