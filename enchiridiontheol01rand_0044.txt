the same nyghte, that he was betrayed, tooke breade: and
when he had geuen thankes‚ brake it: and sayde, Thys is
my body, which is broken for you: Do thys in the remem-
braunce of me. In like maner, when supper was ended, he
gave them the cuppe, sayenge: Thys cuppe is the newe
testament in my bloud. Do thys, as ofte as ye shall drinck
thearof, in the remembraunce of me. Thys was the maner
and order of the Lordes supper: whyche we ought to holde
and kepe: that the remembraunce of so great a benefite, the
passyon and deathe of Christ, be alwaye kepte in mynde:
that, after that the worlde is ended, he may come, and make
vs to sit wyth hym at hys owne borde.

,Μιιεύεφκ What doth baptisme represent and set befor our

ySchoZer. That we are by the Spirite of Christ new borne,
and cleansed from syn: that we be members aud partes ol

Scholer. The supper (as I haue shewed a lytle before) is
a certayne thankfull remembraunce, of the deathe of Christe:
forasmuch as the bread representeth his bodi, betrayed to
be crucifyed for vs: the wyne standeth in steade and place
of his bloude, plentuouslye shed for vs. And euen as by
breade and wyne, our natural bodies are susteined and nou-
rished: so by the body, that is the flesh and bloude of
Christ, the soule is fedde through fayth, and quickened to
the heauenlye and godly lyfe.

Master. Howe come these thynges to passe?

Scholer. Theese thynges come to passe by a certayne se-
create meane, and liuelye working of the spirit: when we
beleue that Christ hath, ones for all, gyuen vppe his bodye
and bloude for us, to make a sacrifice, :md moost pleasant
