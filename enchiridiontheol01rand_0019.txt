THE

CATHECHISME.

-—--*-···—

IT is the deutie of them al, whom Christe hath redeemed Al Chrjsti..

but also children to inherite: So to knowe which is the true profession.

to aunswere to euery demaunde of religion, and to rendre

And this is the playnest way of teachinge, whyche not 'reachyng
onely in philosophie, Socrates, but also in oure 1·eligion,(¹,’,[y,sf¹ueSty “
Apolinarffls, hath used: that bothe by certaine questyons,

forgette not what thei have learned. We therfore hauinge
regarde to the profyte, which we ought to seke in teaching
of youth: and also to shortnes, that in oure hole scholyng,
ther should be nothyng, either ouerflowyng or wantyng:

of my deutie, not only to se that thou bee instructed in {wreeaassgggt-«z

what sort of religion thou followest in this thy tender age:

I thought it best to oppose thee by certain questions, to the
intent I may perfectly knowe, whether thou hast wel or il
trauailed therin. Now therfore tel me (my sonne) what

religion that is which thou professest.
