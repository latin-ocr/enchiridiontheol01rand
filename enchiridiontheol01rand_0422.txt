408 DOC-TRINE OF THE TRINITY AND

Pr. Then you believe the doctrine of the Trinity‚ merely
because the church tells you it is the literal sense of scrip-
ture which you are to follow. But suppose a man sees
no reason for this authority of your church; (as for my

P. That is strange: Is not the church often spoken of
