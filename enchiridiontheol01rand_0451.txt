TRANSUBSTANTIATION COMPARED. 437

trinseeal nomene-13. For, how is it possible for extended
parts to have no relation to place?

P. By relation to place, Ι mean, when the parts of a body
answer to the parts of a place3 but by intrinsecal quantity,
Ι mean, that there is the real order and proportion of parts
in the body itself, but it doth not fill up the place.

Pr. Then you do suppose the body of Christ in the eu-
charist to have all the distinct parts of a body, with their
due order and proportion, but to be in the sacrament after
an invisible manner.

P. Why not?

Pr. Do you think it possible for the real and entire body
of a man to be crowded into the compass of a wafer, with
all the difference of its parts, so that no true part of the
body be missing?

P. Yes, by divine power.

Pr. Do you think a far less thing possible than that,
viz. that a man's head and shoulders, and arms, should be
contained entire and distinct under the nail of his little
finger?

P. Why not?

Pr. Then why may not the greatest body be within the
least? Why may not an elephant be caught in a mouse-
trap, and a rhinoceros be put into a snuff-box? For either
there is a repugnancy in the nature of the thing, for a
greater body to be within a less, or there is not: if not,
then these mentioned instanees are possible3 if there be,
then the supposition of divine power can give no relief, un-
less you suppose, that God can do things repugnant in
themselves, i. e. that he can do things which cannot be
done. But I pray tell me, if the very body of Christ be
by transubstantiation in the wafer, with all its parts in
their due order, then the head must be distant from the
feet, and all the other organs in their proper places3 but
this cannot possibly be supposed, where there is no measure
of distance as place is, and the whole body is in a point.

P. I say again, there is a just order of parts considered

in themselves, but not with respect to place.
