348 BISHOP TAYLOR'S ADVICE

called the Lord's day; and pretend no fears from the com-
mon use of words amongst Christians. For they that make
a business of the words of common use, and reform religion

any of the four first general councils; for these, as they arc
measures of truth, so also of necessityg that is, as they are
safe, so they are sufficient; and beside what is taught by
these no matter of belief is necessary to salvation.

LVII. Let no preacher bring before the people, in his
