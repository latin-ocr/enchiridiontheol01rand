’78 RIDLEY AGAINST

stles doctrine, communion, and breakyng of breade. And

Acts ii. againe they brake breade in euerie house.

Acts xx- And againe in an other place. When they were come
together to breake breade. St. Paule whiche setteth forth
most fullye in his writing‚ boeth the doctrine and the vse
of the Lordes supper, and the sacramentall eatynge, and

1C0r· x. xi·d1·ynkinge of Christes bodie, and bloude, calleth it fiue
tymes‚ breade, breade, breade, breade, breade.

The sacramentall breade is the misticall bodye, and so
is called in scripture, 1 Cor. 10. as it is called the nae
turall bodye of Christe: But Christes misticall bodye is

1 Cor. x. the congregacion of Christians. Now no manne was euer
so fonde, as to saye that that sacramental] bread is tran-
substantiated and changed into the substaunce of the con-
gregation. Wherfore no manne shoulde lykewise thynke
or saie that the breade is transubstantiated, and chaunged
into the naturall substaunce of Christes humaine nature.

But my mynde is not here to wryte what maye bee ga-
thered oute of scriptures for this purpose, but onelye to
wryte here briefelye those whyche seem to me to be the
mooste playne places. Therfore contented to haue spoken
thus muche of the sacramentali breade, nowe I wyll speake
a litle of the Lordes cuppe.

And this shal be my thirde argument grounded vpon
Christes owne woordes. The naturall substance of the
sacramentall wine remaineth stil, and is the materiall sub-
stance of the sacramente of the bloude of Christe, therfore
it is likewise so in the sacramentall bread. I knowe that
he that is of a contrarie opinion will denie the former
parte of my argumente. But I will proue it thus, by the

Mat.xxvi. plaine wordes of Christe himself: Both in Mathewe and

Mar. xiv. in Marke Christes wordes be thus, after the wordes saide
vpon the cuppe. I saye vnto you (saieth Christe) I will
not drinke henseforth of this fruite of the vine trec, vntill
I shall drinke that newe in my fathers kingedome. Here
note, how Christ calleth plainelye his cuppe the fruite of
the vine-tree, but the fruite of the vinc tree is very natural
