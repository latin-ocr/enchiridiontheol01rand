354 BISHOP TAYLOR'S ADVICE &a

cases of conscience, and solid expositions of scripture. Con-
cerning which learned and wise persons are to be consulted.

LXXXI. Let not a curate of souls trouble himself with
any studies but such which concern his own or his people's
duty3 such as may enable him to speak well, and to do
well; but to meddle not with controversies, but such by
which he may be enabled to convince the gainsayers in
things that concern public peace and a good life.

LXXXII. Be careful in all the public administrations
of your parish, that the poor be provided for. Think it no
shame to beg for Christ's poor members3 stir up the people
to liberal alms by your word and your example. Let a.
collection be made every Lord's day, and upon all solemn
meefflngs, and at every communion; and let the collection
be wisely and piously administered: ever remembering,
that at the day of judgment nothing shall publicly be pro-
claimed but the reward of alms and mercy.

LXXXIII. Let every minister be sure to lay up a trea-
sure of comforts and advices, to bring forth for every man's
need in the day of his trouble 3 let him study and heap to-
gether instruments and advices for the promoting of every
virtue, and remedies and arguments against every vice; let
him teach his people to make acts of virtue not only by ex-
ternal exercise‚ but also in the way of prayer and internal
meditation.

In these and all things else that concern the minister’s
duty, if there be difficulty, you are to repair to your bishop
for further advice, assistance, and information.
