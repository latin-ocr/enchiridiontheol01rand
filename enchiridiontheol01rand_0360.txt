346 BISHOP TAYLOR'S ADVICE

preach to the people the duty of their superiors and su-
preme; it can neither come from a good principle, nor tend
to a good end. Every minister ought to preach to his pa-
rish, and urge their duty: St. John the Baptist told the sol-
diers what the soldiers should do, but troubled not their
heads with what was the duty of the scribes and pharisees.

XLVI. In the reproof of sins be as particular as you
please, and spare no man's sin, but meddle with no man's
person; neither name any man, nor signify him, neither re-
proach him, or make him to be suspected: he that doth
otherwise makes his sermon to be a libel, and the ministry
of repentance an instrument of revenge; and so doing he
shall exasperate the man, but never amend the sinner.

XLVII. Let the business of your sermons be to preach
holy life, obedience, peace, love among neighbours, hearty
love, to live as the old Christians did, and the new should;
to do hurt to no man, to do good to every man: for in these
things the honour of God consists, and the kingdom of the
Lord J esus.

XLVIII. Press those graces most that do most good,
and make the least noise; such as giving privately and for-

good works, but it is a great building‚ and many materials
go to the structure of it. It is worth your study‚ for it is
the fulfilling of the commandments.

XLIX. Because it is impossible that charity should live,
unless the lust of the tongue be mortified, let every minis-
ter in his charge be frequent and severe against slanderers,
detractors, and backbiters3 for the crime of backbiting is
the poison of charsty, and yet so common, that it is passed
into a proverb, After a good diomer, Zet us sit down and
backbite our neighbours.

L. Let every minister be careful to observe, and ve-
hcmont in reproving those faults of his parislfioners, of
which the laws cannot or do not take cognizance, such as
are many degrees of intemperate drinkings, gluttony, riot-
