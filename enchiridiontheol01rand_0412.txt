world again: for since the distance between God and his
creatures is taken away, in the matter of worship, there is
nothing left but the declaration of his will; which doth
not exclude more mediators of intercession but upon this
ground, that the mediation of redemption is the foundation
of that of intercession. And it is far more easy for us to
suppose there may be some things too hard for us to un-
derstand in the mystery of our redemption by J esus Christ,
than that at the same time it should be both a duty and a
sin to worship any but the true God with proper divine
worship. For if it be idolatry to give it to a creature, then
itis a great sin; for so the scripture still accounts it: but
if we are bound to give it to Christ, who is but a creature,
then that which in itself is a sin, is now become a necessary
duty ς ⁴which overthrows the natural differences of good and
evil, and makes idolatry to be a mere arbitrary thing. And
Ι take it for granted, that in matters of religion moral diffi-
culties are more to be regarded than intellectual; because
religion was far more designed for a rule of our actions,
than for the satisfaction of our curiosity. And upon due
examination we shall find, that there is no such frightful
appearance of difficulties in the mystery of the incarnation,
as there is in giving divine worship to a creature.

And it ought to be observed, that those very places which
are supposed to exclude Christ from being the true God,
must, if they have any force, exclude him from divine wor-
ship. For they are spoken of God as the object of our wor-
ship; but if he be not cxcluded from divine worship, then
neither is he from being the true God ς which they grant he
is by office, but not by nature.

But a God by office, who is not so by nature, is a new
and incomprehensible mystery. A mystergy laiddefn from
ages and generations as to the church of God; but not
made known hy tlte gospel oflm's Son.

This is such a kind of niystery as the heathen priests had,
who had gods many, med lorcls many, as the apostle saith,
i. e. many by office, although but one by nature. But if
the Christian religion had owned one God by nature, and
