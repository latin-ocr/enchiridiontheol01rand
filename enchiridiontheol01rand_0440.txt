426 DOCTRINE OF THE TRINITY AND

Pr. We have been all this while comparing these two
doctrines as to scripture, and now you see the disproportion
so very great, as to number and variety, you say, One is as
good as an hundred; but that one had need to be wonder-
fully clear, which this is very far from, since many of your
own writers do confess transubstantiation cannot be drawn
from it; as Bellarmin himself owns, and he affirms it ‘⁶ not
‘⁶ to be improbable, that no place of scripture is so clear
‘⁶ and express for transubstantiation, but learned and acute
‘⁴ men may doubt whether it can be drawn from it, setting
‘⁶ aside the church's declaration.” But neither Bellarmin,
nor any one who attends to the force of the former proofs
of the divinity of Christ, can say, that any reasonable man
can doubt of it; and that he must at last resolve all into

the church's authority.
P. Have not learned and acute men doubted as well of

the divinity of Christ, as of transubstantiation? And there-
fore in that respect. they are both alike.

Pr. We do not insist upon men's bare doubting, but on
the reason of their doubting. And when but one single
place is produced, which is yielded not to be sufficient of
itself to prove the doctrine; there is much more cause of
doubting, than where such multitudes of places are pro-
duced3 and no doubt is made by those who favour tran-
substantiation, but that they do fully prove the divinity of
Christ.

P. It seems then we must to reason at last. And for my
part, I must tell you, I think that parallel much the easiest.
For, that three distinct Persons should be in one individual
nature, and that the most pure and simple Being, seems to
me to be more absurd than transubstantiation.

Pr. Let us set aside the comparing absurdities at present,
and only examine, in point of reason, the great absurdity of
three Persons being in one individual divine nature.

P. Ι did hardly believe you would have the courage to
defend the doctrine of the Trinity in point of reason3 but
I see you are a bold man, and will venture farther than
wlser men.
