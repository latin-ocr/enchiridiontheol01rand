ΟΝ ΤΗΕ TRINITY. 477

neetion and circumstances in which they are mentioned in
scripture, have plainly a personal Signification; each of them,
without any figure of speech, being determined to signify some
intelligent Being acting in such a manner as is there related.

There needs no proof of this, the plain distinction of
persons imported by those terms being the chief argument
made use of to shew that they cannot all be applied to God,
but must necessarily signify tlzree distinet Beings .· but that
they are all applied to God in scripture has been proved al-
ready; and therefore Fatlzer, Son, and Holgy Ghost may be
considered as persons or personat characters, which do not
imply any distinction (ffbeing or nature.

The Greeks are supposed to have meant the same by Heb. i. 3·
hypostasis as we do by person, this word being sometimes
the very translation of the other; and if so, there is the
same ground for the use of both: but if they meant any
thing else, they could hardly have so good warrant for it
from revelation. ἶ ”

Now, that one of these persons or hypostases should be
both God and man, there is this foundation in the scriptures
for. He who is there called the Son of God did certainly
appear in the Zikeness osmen, being in all respects, sin only
excepted, truly and properly man‚· as his birth, necessities,
suffering& and death sufficiently testify. It is certain also
that the same J esus Christ, who was called the Son ‘ff God,
and was made in the likeness (gf man, is affirmed by St.
Paul, Phil. iii. 7, 8. to have been in the sbi-m (gf God, when
he took the nature of man upon him.

But besides this, and many other texts to the same effect,
it is plain, from what before has been proved, that God did
suffer himself to be worshipped and adored in and by the
man Christ Jesus: the least that can be inferred from
which is, that God was more immediately and peculiarly pre-
sent in Christ, than ever he is said to have been any where
else: as in the heavens, Jewish temple, between the cheru-
binis, in prophete and holy men, who spake as they were
moved by the Spirit of God. What created object was ever
allowed to intercept the worship paid to God, or share with
him in it? Were the heavens, the temple, the cherubim or
