TRANSUBSTANTIATION. 85

that but in his masse onelie, may receiue the sacrament of

the bloud. And call ye this (maisters) mysterium fidei?

alas, alas, I feare me this is before God, mysterium iniqui-

tatis, the mysterie of iniquitee, such as saint Paule speketh

of in his epistle to the Thessalonians. The Lord be merci· 2 Thess. ii.
full vnto vs, and blesse VS, lighten his cowntenaunce vppon Psalm mil·
vs, and be mercifull vnto vs. That we maye knowe thy

waye vppon earth, and among all people thy salvation.

This kind of oblation standeth vppon transubstantyacion

his germayne coosyn, and doo growe both uppon one
grownd, the Lord weede it owt of his vyneyard shortlie

(if it be his blessed will and pleasure) that bitter roote.

To speke of this oblation howe muche it is injuryous

furth by the scriptures, according to Gods gracious gifte of
my poore knowledge, whether the true sense and meaninge
of Christes wordes in the institution of his holy supper, do
require anye transubstantiation (as they call it) or that the
verye substaunce of bread and wine doe remayne styll in
the Lordes supper, and be the material} substaunce of the
holye sacramente of Christe our Sauioures blessed bodie and
bloude.

Yet there remaineth one vaine Quiddite of Duns in this
matter, the which because some that write nowe do seme to
like it so well, that they haue strypped hym oute of Dunses
dustie and darcke termes, and pricked him and painted him
in freshe colores of an eloquente stile, may therfore deceiue
the more excepte the error be warcly escheued.

Dunse saith in these wordes of Christ, this is my body,
this pronoune demonstratiue‚ meaning the worde (this) if ·
