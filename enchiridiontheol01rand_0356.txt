342 BISHOP TAYLOR'S ADVICE

to the measures of the laws, and the conduct of their go-
vernors.

XXVI. Suffer no quarrel in your 11311511, and speedily
suppress it when it is begun, and though all wise men will
abstain from interposing in other men“s affairs, and espe-
cially in matters of interest, which men love too well; yet
it is your duty here to interpose, by persuading them to
friendships, reconcil‘ements, moderate prosecutions of their

pretences; and, by all means you prudently 5311, to bring
them to peace and brotherly kindness.

XXVII. Suffer no 11011555 of debauchery, of drunken-
ness or lust in your parishes; but implore the assistances of
authority for the suppressing of all such meeting-places and
nurseries of impiety3 and as for places of public entertain-

ment‚ take care that they observe the rules of Christian
piety, and the allowed measures of the laws.

XXVIII. If there be any papists or sectaries in your
parishes, neglect not frequently to confer with them in the
spirit of meekness, and by the importunity of wise discourses
seeking to gain them. But stir up no violences against
them; but leave them (if they be incurable) to the wise and
merciful disposition of the laws.

XXIX. Receive not the people to doubtful disputa-
tions: and let no names of sects or differing religions be
kept up amongst you, to the disturbance of the public
peace and private charity: and teach not the people to esti-
mate their piety by their distance from any opinion, but by
their saith in Christ, their obedienee to God and the laws,
and their love to all Christian people, even though they be
deceived.

XXX. Think no man considerable upon the point or
pretence of a tender conscience, unless he live a good life,
and in all things endeavour to approve himself void of of-
fence both towards God and man: but if he be an humble
person, modest and inquiring, apt to learn and desirous of
information; if he seeks for it in 311 ways reasonable and
pious, and is obedient to 131115, 111511 take care of him, use
him tenderly‚ persuade him meekly, reprove him gendy,
