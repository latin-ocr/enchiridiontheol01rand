440 DOCTRINE OF THE TRINITY AND

P. What say you then to the mystery of the incarna-
tion? ‘⁶ Is it not more wonderful? as Bellarmin observes,
“ that there should 116 0116 hypostasis in two natures than
‘⁶ one body in two places? since the union is greater be-
“ tween the hypostasis and the natures, than between the
‘⁶ body and the places it is 1ος 1116 0116 being intrinsecal and
“ substantial, the other extrinseca] and accidental. And
“ that hypostasis is the same with the divine nature, and
⁶‘ yet is most closely united with the human nature, which
‘⁶ is so different from the divine3 so that it is incompre-
“ hensible by us, how in that union the natures are not con-
‘⁶ founded, or the hypostasis divided.''

Pr. Suppose now we grant all this, that there is an in«
comprehensible mystery in the incarnation, what follows
from thence? Have 1 not hitherto owned, that there must
be something incomprehensible by us, in what relates to the
divine nature? And it is the less wonder it is so in the in·-
carnation, wherein an union is implied between an infinite
and finite nature3 when the union of the soul and body,
though both finite, is above our comprehension, though we
ourselves consist of so‘uls and bodies so united? But what
consequence is it, if we are not able to explain this, that
then we must admit that the same body may be not merely
in two, but in ten thousand places at the same time? i. e.
If we cannot explain the hypostatica] union, then all man-
ner of absurdities must go down with us, that relate to
things of a very different nature from it.

P. I am glad to find you are set at last, and that now
you have a difficulty before you which you can never get
through.

Pr. Be not too confident; I have only hitherto denied
the consequence as to the difficulties of transubstantiation.
But it is possible, that, setting aside the confusion of school
terms, I may be able to give a far more intelligible and rea-
sonable account of the incarnation itself, than you can ever
do of transubstantiation.

P. First shew that it is possible, and then explain the
manner of it.
