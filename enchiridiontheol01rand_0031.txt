THE CATHECHISME. 17

it was necessarye, that he should ryse again with glorie,
that the sayengs of Dauid and other prophetes of God
myghte be fulfylled, whych told before: that neither hys
body shoulde se corruption: nor hys soule be left in hel.
As for vs, we neither had bene iustified, nor had had anye
hope left to ryse agayne, had not he rysen agayne‚ as Paule
doth in diuerse places playnlye shewe. For if he had re-
mayned in the prison of death, in the grave: and bene
holden in corruption, as al men besyde: how could we haue
hoped for safty by hym whych saued not himself. It was
mete therfore, and needefull, for the part that he had in
hand: and for the chiefe staye of our sauegarde: that
Christe shoulde fyrst delyuer hymselfe from deame, and
afterwarde assure vs of safetye by his vprisyng agayne.

Master. Thou hast touched (my sonne) the chiefe cause
of Christes risinge agayne. Now would Ῑ faine heare thy
mynde of his going vp into heauen. What answere think-
est thou is to be made to them, that say: it had ben better
for hym, to tarie hear with vs, presentlye to rule and go-
uerne vs: For, besyde other diuerse causes, it is likelye,
that the loue of the people toward theyr prince, specially
beyng good and graciouS, should grow the greater by his
present company.

Scholer. All theese thynges whych he should do present, Clu—ist go-

fendeth, rebuketh, punysheth, correcteth: and performeth
all suche thynges as do become such a prince, or rather
God himself. Al those thynges (I saye) performeth he,
which belong eyther to our neede or profit: honour or com-
moditie. Beside this, Christ is not so altogether absent How
from the world, as mani do suppose. For albeit the sub- ἓὲὲὲἐξεῆζζᾱ
staunce of his body be taken vp from vs: yet is his God- presente iu

to the sight of our eyes. For thynges that be not bodylye‚
can not be perceiued by any bodyly meane. Who euer
sawe hys owne soule? No man. Yet what is thear more
present? or what to ech man nearer, than hys owne soule.
