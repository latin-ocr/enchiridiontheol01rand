450 BISHOP GASTRELL

of all other words that shall be used on these occasions, it is
in vain to shift the measure, when there is never another to
be found which can or ought to reach farther.

It may, however, sometimes be necessary to change this
method, and introduce new terms to secure the true saith
against the false interpretations of such as pervert scripture.
F or if heretics will make use of new expressions to contra-
dict the received doctrine, we must have new terms to ex-
press the same truth in, in opposition to their heresy. And
in this case the 'church may very reasonably require her
members to shew their steady continuance in the ancient
faith, by the use of such terms as plainly infer their denial
of any later erroneous inventions set up against it.

3. There are a third sort of men in the world, who pre-
tend, that there is no mystcry proposed to us as an object
of faith; and in order to make this of the Trinity appear
to be none, they bring a cloud over the whole Bible, and
with strange forced criticisms and allegories give the very
plainest texts such an unusual mysterious turn, as neither
the language will bear, nor is any ways consistent with the
design or character of the holy writers.

But this is a very odd preposterous method of explaining
scripture, by darkening a great part of it to illustrate the
rest; and as ridiculous a project of healing divisionS, as pull-
ing down a whole side of a standing wall to mend a breach.

And after all, the Socinian hypothesis seems to me to
have more of mystery, and contradiction to natural reason “
in it, than what is objected to the catholic doctrine.

I am not for clogging the faith, nor multiplying myste-
ries; yet we ought not presently to deny what we do not
understand3 but soberly and impartially consider how'much
we are able to comprehend, and how far we are obliged to
believe what we do not.

The method therefore 1 design to observe in the follow-
ing discourse shall be different from any of those now men-
tioned. Ι shall not go about to press men to a blind vene-
ration or presumptuous belief of any thing without exami-
nation, or in defiance to reason: I shall not offer to impose
