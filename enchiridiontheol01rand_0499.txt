ΟΝ ΤΗΕ ΤΒῙΝΙΤΥ. 485

rality of Gods: for, according to the notions Ι have there
shewed we have of the nature and attributes of God, it is
undeniably certain to every man's experience, that we can-
not conceive more than one God: all our endeavours to com-
prehend more are only repetitions of the same idea.

Let those therefore take care to answer this accusation,
who, under pretence of giving a more rational account of
what we are to believe in this point, set up created subordi-
nate gods to be partners with their Maker in the glory and
worship due to him.

Resides, we do explicitly declare, that there is but One
God at the same time we make profession of our faith in a
Trinity, or Three Persona

2. In the next place therefore, we are accused of believ-
ing contradictions3 and consequently of destroying all the
certainty of natural knowledge3 which fence being down,
there is no error so gross or absurd but may be obtruded
upon us3 and transubstantiation has as good a pretence to
be an article of our saith as the Trinity. But I need not
make any particular answer to this objection, having proved
at large already that we neither do nor can believe a Trinity
in any sense that contradicts the plain and evident princi-
ples of natural reason. We do not believe there can be
more Gods than One,· that One can be Three in the same
respect it is One ; or that One God can be Three z‘n the
Same sense three men are three persons‚· or any other pro-
position that is inconsistent with those natural notions which
are the foundation of all our other knowledge. But the pa-
trons of transubstantiation cannot make this plea, who in
this one particular deny those very principles which upon
all other occasions they rely upon with the greatest assu-
rance. Did they only affirm, that Christ was present in the
sacrament in some way or manner they could not compre-
hend, but in no way repugnant to the plain and necessary
dictates of well informed sense and right reason, there
might be then some resemblance found betwixt this doc-
trine and that of the Trinity3 but at present the compari-
son is palpably and notoriously unjust.
