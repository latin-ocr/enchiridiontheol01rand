460 BISHOP GASTRELL

ceive the whole image of it at once, we take it in at different
times, from different points of sight3 and yet for all this,
we find no more reason to doubt of the unity of such an
object, than of any other, whose image came into the soul
entire at one act of vision; for we easily conceive there may
be other organs of sight, which would receive the whole ob-
ject together: and from thence we conclude further, that
there may be also some other mind more perfect than ours,
which perceives that as one simple idea, which we cannot
apprehend but by an union of several different conceptions:
from whence it follows, that the most perfect mind, which
is God, is the only true and proper standard of all unity
and distinction.

The sum of all my thoughts is this: What is meant by
one or more, the same or different ideas, is better to be con-
ceived by inward reflection, than can possibly be explained
by words.

Such an idea, which is not distinguishable into different
appearances, Ι call a simple idea.

When Ι have any thought or perception, which is re-
solvable into several ideas, I call this 3 complex or com-
pozmded motion. And hence I term any being simple or
compoumlecl, according as it is perceivable by some mind,
under one simple appearance, or a complex idea.

Whether my ideas are agreeable to the real natures of
thingS, or those original patterns in the mind of God, I
cannot certainly know; but when they are the same, and
when they differ from one another, I plainly perceive,
though I cannot always judge of the identity or distinction
of things, according as they are represented to my under-
standing, under the same or different appearances ς for here
I should be sometimes mistaken too, as it is plain Ι often
must, if I judged of the real unity or multiplicity of things
by my own ideas.

The notions we have of the unity of things without us
come the nearest that can be imagined to our ideas ospoz‘nt
and continued artension; one of which represents simple
unity, the other compounded; the one we apply to what
