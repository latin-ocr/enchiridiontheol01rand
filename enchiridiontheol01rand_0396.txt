persecutor, and injuriouffl but yet he adds, that he obtained
mercgy because lae did z't ignorantlgs, in unbeliqf. How then
is St. Paul the clzz‘qfofsz'nners ,9 Are sins of ignorance and
mistake the greatest of sins for which Christ died? Is there
no empiation for any other by «Iesus Christ? What will
become then of all such who sin against knowledge and
conscience, and not in ignorance and unbelicgf? Can none
of these hope for mercy by Christ J esus, although they do
1 John i. 7-truly repent? But the blood of Christ is said elsewhere to
cleanse us from all sin ,· not while we continue in them, but
if we repent and forsake them. And J esus Christ is said
xJohnii.2.to be a propitiation sor our sins; and not for ourS only,
butjbr tlte sins of the whole world. And therefore this
expression of St. Paul notes his great humility and deep
sense of his own sins; but doth not exclude others from the
hopes of pal-don, whose sins have other aggravations than
his had. For, if we leave out the last words as peculiar to
his case, yet the other contain in them a true proposition,
and of the greatest importance to mankind3 This is afaith-

This, you may say, is a matter out of all doubt among
all such who hope for salvation by Christ J esus; for all are
agreed, that one way or other we are to be saved by him.
But there is great difficulty as to the way of saving sinners
by Christ J esus: whether by the doctrine and example of
the man Christ J esus3 by the power he attained through
his sufferings3 or, by the eternal Son of God's assuming
our nature, and suffering in our stead‚ in order to the re-
conciling God to us, and making a propitiation for our sins.
These are two very different hypotheses or notions of
Chrisffs coming to save sz‘mzers: and the. former seems more
easy to be understood and believed3 and the other seems
to have insuperable difficulties in point of reason, and to
run our religion into mysteries‚ which expose our saith, and
make Christianity appear contemptible to men of sense and
understanding. Is it not therefore much better to embrace
such a scheme of it, as will have the least objection against
