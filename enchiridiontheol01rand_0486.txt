4272 BISHOP GASTRELL

ters of it should teach, baptize, or bless the people in any
name but God's.

It cannot be imagined but the people must equally be-
lieve in those, in whose names they are baptized or blessed ε
they must believe that those who are called upon to bestow
graces and blessings upon thern, are able to give what they
are called upon for. And whatever is meant by baptizing
in tlte name (ff tlte Fatlzer, Son, and Holy Ghost, it seems
very plain that these three are all equally concerned in
what is done in that sacrament. Whether in this form of
baptism be signified, on the minister-’s part, the authority or
commission by which he acts in his administration3 or whe-
ther, on the part of the person baptized, be meant any
acknowledgment or confession, submission or dedication of
himself ; or whether this phrase ‘in the name, or (according
to the Greek) into the name, does imply all this, and more;
the whole force and importance of the expression does in
the same extent belong to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
The power and authority here received is derived from all
three: they are all<to be acknowledged as Authors effour
εαῖυαιὶοης all infallible, and to be believed in what they
teach; have all the same title to our submission and obe-
dience, and are joint parties in that covenant we make in
baptism.

The inference from hence is very plain and easy: that if
any one of these terms signify God, they must all three
signify God; and if all three signify God, they must all
three signify one and tlte same G0d‚· for God is but one.
Now that the one supreme God, the Lord and Maker of all
things, is here meant by the word Famem is a thing not
questioned3 and therefore Son and Holy Ghost are ternis
expressive of the same divine nature.

Should we but suppose the contrary, that by Son was
meant only a mere man, or some heavenly being cfflzz'ghest
rank under G0d; and by Holy Glzost was signified only
some created spirit, inferior to the Son, or the power, ff-
cacy, love, favour, or virtue of God, how strange would
such a form of baptism appear? I baptize thee in the name
