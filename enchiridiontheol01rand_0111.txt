TRANSUBSTANTIATION. 97

ture of breade to his nature in vnitie of person, and make

of the breade God?

Nowe let vs heare Theodoretus, whiche is the laste of
the three Greke authoures. He writeth in his dialoge Con-
tra Eutychen, thus. He that calleth his naturali bodie,
corne and breade, and also named himselfe a vine tree, euen
he the same hath honoured the SymboleS, that is the saera-
mentall signes, with the names of his bodye and bloud, not
chaunginge in dede the nature it selfe, but adding grace
vnto the nature. What canne be mor plainelye saide then
this, that this olde writer saieth, that although the Sacra-
mentes beare the name of the bodye and bloude of Christ,
yet is not their nature chaunged, but abydeth still, and
where is then the Papistes transubstanciation?

The same writer in the ΞΜ Dialoge of the same workc‚
againste the aforesaid heretique Eutyches, writeth yet more
plainlie against this error of transubstantiation, if any thing
can be saide to be more plaine: For he maketh theretique
speake thus against him that defendeth the true doctrine
whom he calleth Orthodoxus.

As the sacramentes of the bodie and bloude of oure
Lorde are one thinge before the inuocation, and after the
inuocation they be chaunged, and are made an other: So
likewise, the Lordes bodie, saith the heretique, is after the
assumption or ascention into heauen turned into the sub-
staunce of Godde3 theretique meaninge therby that Christe
after his assention remaineth no more a man.

To this Orthodoxus aunswereth thus, and saieth to there-
tique. Thou art taken (saith he) in thine owne snare, for
those misticall symbolles, or sacramentes, after the sanctifi-
cation, doe not go out of their owne nature, but they tarrie
and abide still in their substance, figure, and shape, yca and
are sensibly seene, and groped to bee the same they were
before, δῖε.

At these woordes the Papistes doe startle, and to say the
tuith, these wordes be so plaine, so full, and so cleare, that
they can not tell what to saye, but yet will not cease to goe
about to plaic the Cutles, and to caste their eolloures ouer
