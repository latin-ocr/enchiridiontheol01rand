ΟΝ SCRIPTURE MYSTERIES. 389

“ stood. But the scripture never calls that a mystery Discourseos
‘⁶ which is incomprehensible {sn itsegf} though never so much iiam?
‘⁶ revealed.” ἃς· Ρ- 5·

This is the main force of the objection, which 1 shall en-
deavour to remove, by shewing,

(1.) That God may justly require from us in general
the belief of what we cannot comprehend.

(2.) That, which way soever the way of salvation by
Christ be explained, there will be something of that na-

of faith run into greater difficulties than those who assert
them.

(ὃ.) That no inore is required as a necessary article of

scripture be applied to such particular doctrines, whose
substance is revealed, but the manner of them is incompre-

word, whereby to express things truly revealed, but above
our comprehension? We are certain the word mystery is
used for things far less difficult and abstruse; and why may
it not then be fitly applied to such matters, which are
founded on divine revelation, but yet are too deep for us to
go to the bottom of them ? Are there not mysteries in arts,
mysteries in nature, mysteries in providence? And what
absurdity is there to call those mysterieS, which in some
measure are known, but in much greater unknown to us?
Although therefore in the language of scripture it be grant-
ed, that the word mystery is most frequently· applied to
things before hidden, but now revealed, yet there is no in-
congruity in calling that a mystery, which being revealed,
hath yet something in it which our understandings cannot
reach to. But it is mere cavilling to insist on a word, if the
thing itself be granted. The chief thing therefore to be
done is, to shew that God may require from us the belief of
such things which are incomprehensible by us. For, God
