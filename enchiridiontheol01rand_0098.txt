84 RIDLEY AGAINST

St. Austin did the other. Wherunto that exposition of St.
Austen maie seame to 110 1110 more mete, for that Christe 111
1115 supper, to the commaundcment of eatinge and drinkinge
of his bodie, and bloud‚ addeth, do this in remembrance
of me, whiche wordes suerlye were the keye that opened
and reueled this spirituall 'and godlye exposition vnto St.
Austen.

But I haue taried longer in settinge fourth the forme of
Christes woordes upon the Lordes cuppe written by Paule
and Luke then I intended to do. And yet in speaking of
the forme of Christes wordes spoken vpon his cuppe, it
commeth now vnto my remembraunce the forme of wordes
vsed in the lattin Masse vpon the Lordes cuppe: VVherof
I doe not a 111110 maruaile what should be the cause, seing

I doe not see the misterie.

And because I se in the vse of the lattin Masse, the sa-
crament of the blond abused, when it is denied to the laie
men, cleane contrarie to Gods most certaine worde: For
why I beseche the shoulde the sacramente of Christes
bloude, be denied vnto the laye Christian, more then to the
priest? dyd not Christ shead his bloude as well for the laye
godlye man, as for the godlye preste? yf thow wilt saye,
year& that. 110 11111 50, 11111 yet the sacrament of the bloud is
not to be receyued withowt the offer-ing vpp and sacrifycing
therof vnto God the Father‚ both for the quicke‚ and for
the dead, and no man maye make oblatyon of Christos
bloude vnto G0d‚ but a priest‚ and therfore the priest, and
