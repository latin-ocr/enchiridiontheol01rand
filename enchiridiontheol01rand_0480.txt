466 BISHOP GASTRELL

just now mentioned concerning the conformity of ideas with
their patterns.

From whence it follows, that, according to the notions we
are capable of framing of unity and distinctim, which I
have particularly examined, with reference to the holy Tri-
nity, all the personal distinction we can conceive in the De-
ity must be founded upon some accessory ideas extrinsecal
to the divine nature3 a certain combination of which ideas
makes up the second notion signified by the word person.

And if we fairly and impartially examine 'our own
thoughts upon this subject, we shall find, that, when we
name God the Father, we conceive the idea of God so far
as we are capable of conceiving it, as acting so and so, un-
der such respects and ‘relations3 and ¹when we name God
the Son, we conceive nothing else but the same idea of God
over again under different 1·elations‘; and so likewise of the
Holy Ghost.

But if this be all that is meant by Trinity in Unity, 'three
Persons and one God, where is that stupendous mystery so
much reverenced and adored by some? What becomes of
the great diffleulty and obscurity complained of by others?
What is it that has puzzled the understandingS‚ and stag-
gered the saith of so many learned and »inquisitive men in
all ages since this doctrine was first delivered? This is an
invincible prejudice against the account now given, and in-
deed against any‘ other explication whatsoever that has no-
thing in it hard to be understood, or believed: for how can
it be imagined that what has passed for a mystery these six-
teen hundred years, should now at last be comprehended as
plainly as a common ordinary notion?

But if this account of the Trinity be too easy, and falls
far short of those high expressions of distinction found in
scripture, (as 1 think it doeS,) and no other grounded upon
any notions our souls have framed of unity and distinction
can be true or consistent, (as Ι have before particularly
proved,) then it necessarily follows, that God must be one

and three in some way or manner not conceivable by human
understanding.
