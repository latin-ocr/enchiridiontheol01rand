94 RIDLEY AGAINST

that saiynge; Except ye cate the fleash of the sonne of
manne, and drinke his bloude, διο. this letter doeth kill.
Yf in that place the letter doth kyll‚ wherin is commaunded
the eating of Christes fleash, then suerlie in those wordes of
Christ, wherin Christe commaundeth vs to eate his bodie,
the literall sense therof likewise doth kill. For it is no lesse
crime, but euen the same, and all one in the literal sense, to
eate Christes body, and to eate Christes fleashe. Wherfore
if the one doth kylL except it be vnderstanded figuratiuelye,
and spirituallie, then the other suerly doth kill likewise.
But that to eate Christes fleashe doeth kill so vnderstanded‚
Origine affirmeth plainli in his words aboue rehersed.
Wherfore it can not be iustlye denied‚ but to eate Christes
body literallie vnderstanded‚ must nedes after him kill like-
wise.

stande that in hys proper sense whiche oughte to be taken
figurafiuelie, were to the carnall manne a daungerous per-
rill, but to the spirituall manne none at all.

Nowe to Chrisostome‚ whome I bring for the seconde
writer in the Greke churche. He speakinge againste the
vnholie vsyng of mans bodie, whiche after S. Paule ought
to be kepte pure, and holie as the verie temple of the holy
ghoste‚ saith thus: If it be a fauste, saith he, to translate
tho holied vesselles (in the whiche is not contained the trwe
bodie of Christe, but the misterie of the bodie) to priuate
vscs, how muche more offence is it to abuse and defile the
vcsseles of our bodie. These be the woordes of Chrysos-
tome. But Ι trowe that here many foule shiftes are deuised
to defeate this place. Ἰ

The authoure, saith one, is suspected: I answere, but
