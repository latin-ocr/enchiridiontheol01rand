ΟΝ THE TRINITY. 473

of God, Peter the apostle, and the power or love of God :
or, I baptize thee in tlte name of God, Michael the arch-
angel, and Rapkael a miozisterz'ng spirit. There needs no
more but a bare mention of such an exposition to shew the
falsehood of it: what absurd consequences may be drawn
from it, I shall leave to every man's particular reflection.
Another thing which mightily confirmed me in this be-
lief, that the Father, 8οη, and Holy Ghost, so often named
in scripture, are one and the same God, under those three
different appellations, was this; that the Son, who is the
same with him that is in other places called tlte Lord, and
tlte Lord Jesus Christ, and sometimes only Jesus, or Christ,
was worshipped with a religious worship by those that fol-

* lowed him and embraced his gospel: for if he that was

called the 8οη of God, 01· Christ, was thus to be worship-
ped, it plainly and evidently follows from hence, according
to all the notions we have of God and religion, either from
nature or revelation, that the 8οη was also God, the same
true and only God with the F ather.

And if the Son be allowed to be God as well as the Fa-
ther, it will be easily admitted that the Holgy Ghost is so
t00, who appears in scripture invested with all the same
characters of divinity: for Famem Son, and HoZy Ghost,
are as consistent with the unity of the Godhead, as F ather
and 8οη only3 and besides, there is greater difficulty in
conceiving the 8οη to be God, than the Holy Ghost, be-
cause of his human nature. But that he was God mansffest

’ in theflesk, is, I say, apparent from the divine worship that

was paid to him: for that God only is to be worshipped, is
an evident principle, as well as an indispensable duty; and
I can as soon believe a thing to be, and not to be, as that
any thing that is not God should be worshipped as God.
Now that Christ received the honour and worship due
to God only, is plain from abundance of places of scrip-
ture, where we find he was not only adored with all the
. outward expressions of reverence and devotion, but con-
fessed and acknowledged to be God by an application of
the divine attributes to him, such as agree only to God, and
are incommunicable to any other, as might be proved at
