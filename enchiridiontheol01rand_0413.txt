ΟΝ SCRIPTURE MYSTERIES. 399

only one by office, the heathens had been to blame chiefly
in the number of their gods by office, and not in the divine
worship which they gave to them. But St. Paul blames Ga1.iv.8.
the heathens for doing service to them which by nature are
no gods,· not for doing it without divine authority, nor
for mistaking the person who was God by office, but in
giving divine worship to them who by nature were πο g0d85
which he would never have said, if by the Christian doc-
trine divine worship were to be given to one who was not
God by nature.

But these are indeed incomprehensible mysteries, how a
man by nature can be a God really and truly by office;
how the incommunicable perfectioris of the divine nature
can be communicated to a creature3 how God should give
his glorgy to momen and by his own command require that
to be given to a creature, which himself had absolutely for-
bidden to be given to any besides himself. It is said by a
famous J esuit‚ (Ι will not say how agreeably to their own
doctrines and practices about divine worship‚) ‘⁶ that the Smiglec.
‘⁶ command of God cannot make him worthy of divine wor- &wlff-''³12¹''-
“ ship‚ who without such a command is not worthy of it. carn. Nat.
“ But it is very absurd to say, that he that is unworthy of it p. 45'
‘⁶ without a command, can become worthy by it; for it
‘⁶ makes God to command divine honour to be given to one
‘⁶ who cannot desei-ve it.” (For no mere man can deserve
to be made God.) ‘⁶ But it is more agreeable to the divine Nova Mon-
“ nature and will not to give his honour to a creature.'' · ῑὶῗΐῗρἆο·

(3.) But after all the invectives of these enemies to .
mysteries, we do not make that which we say is incompre-
hensible to be a necessary article of faith‚ as it is incompre-
hensible3 but we do assert, that what is incomprehensible
as to the manner, may be a necessary article as far as it is
plainly revealed. As in the instances I have already men-
tioned of the creation and resurrection of the dead; would
they in earnest have men turn infidels as to these things till
they are able to comprehend all the difficulties which relate
to them? If not, why should this suggestion be allowed as
to the mysteries which relate to our redemption by Jesus
