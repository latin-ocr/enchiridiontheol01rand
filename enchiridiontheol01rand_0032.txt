18 THE CATHECHISME.

Spiritual thinges ar not to be seen, but wyth the eye of the
spirite. Thearfore he that in earth wyll see the Godhead
of Christ: let hym open the eyes, not of his bodye, but of
hys mynde, but of his saith: and he shall see him present,
whom eye hath not> seen: he shall see him present, and in
the myddes of them, whearsoeuer be two or three gathered
together in his name: he shal see him present wyth vs, euen
vnto the ende of the world. What sayde I? shall he see
Christe present? Yea, he shall both se and feele him dwell-
yng within himselfe: in sutch sorte as he dothe hys owne
proper soule. For he dwelleth and abydeth in the mynde
and harte of hym whyche fasteneth all hys trust in hym.

Christes Master. Very well, but our confession is that he is as-

heauens, to the very roial throne of God, muste needes be
euident by moste iust reason, that hys glory and maiestye
myghte in comparison agreably answer to the proportion of
hys basenesse and reproehefull estate. This doth Paul
teach vs, in hys wrytynge to the Philippians: he became
obedient euen vnto death: yea, the very deathe of the
crosse. W hearfore God hath both aduauneed hym to the
hyest state of honour: and also gcuen hym a name aboue
all names: that at the name of J esus eueri kne shold bow,
of al things in heauen, earth and hell. But although he be
