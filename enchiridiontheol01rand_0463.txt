ON THE TRINITY. 449

No doubt therefore we may, and ought carefully to ex-
amine the faith and principles we design for the rule of our
lives, and endeavour to understand all our religion so far, as
to be able to justify it, both to ourselves and unbelievers.

We ought indeed to proceed with all the caution and
humility imaginable, and take a just estimate of our task
and abilities: but to be denied the liberty either of using
or obeying our reason, is a suspicious as well as an unjust
restraint.

2. There are others, who call the doctrine of the Trinity
an incomprehensible mystergy, and yet are at a great deal of
pains to bring it down to a level with human understand-
ing; and are all very earnest to have their own particular
explicatioris acknowledged as necessary articles of saith: but
the number and disagreement of the expositors plainly dis-
cover the vanity of such pretences.

This has proved so unsuccessful a way, that, instead of
uniting the different judgments of Christians in one point,
it has broke the controversy into a thousand more: for zeal
and opposition raising up a great many assertors of the com-
mon belief, and every one looking out for some new terms
and modes of speech, which might be fuller and more ex-
pressive than those in question, the differences and disputes
were by consequence proportionably multiplied. For the
terms and forms of speech made use of being capable of
several senses, and each of them attended with other acces-
sory ideas, mistakes must necessarily arise, and divers new
thoughts be suggested to such whose heads were employed
upon the same subject: and thus it came to pass, that de-
fences and vindications of the orthodox saith produced more
heresies.

Wherefore in all such matters as these, which are too big
to be grasped, we had better sit down contented with what
we have firm hold of, than tire ourselves with vain endea-
vours to take in more. It would certainly be the truest
and the safest way, strictly to confine ourselves to scripture
expressions, and never speak of supernatural things but in

the language of revelation; which being the proper standard
