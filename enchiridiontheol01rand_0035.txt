THE CATHECHISME. 21

haue had a trew bodye, but a fantasticall: whearof shoulde
haue spronge foorthwith a thowsand errors: all whyeh he
hath dispatched by carienge hys bodie vp whole to heauen.
In the meane season he, remaynynge imfisible, gouerneth
his kingdome and common xveaIe, that is his chureh, with
soueraign wysdome and power. It is for men to rule theyr
commune weales by a certayne ciuile policie of men: but
for Christ and God‚ by a heauenlye godlyke order. But
all that I haue hetherto sayde conteyneth but a small par-
cell of the profytte, that we take by the caryenge vp of
Christes body into heauen. For ther ar many more thing-es,
that heare might be rehearsed, whearof large store of fruite
is to be gathered. But specially this may not be left vn-
spoken: that the benefits are suteh and so greate‚ which
come vnto vs by the deathe, risynge agayne, and goinge vp
of Christ: as no tonge eyther of men or angeles is able to
expres. And that you maye knowe my mynde hearein: I
wyll rehearse certayne of the chefe: whearunto as it wear
two principal poyntes, the rest may be applyed. I say
thearfore: that both by these and other doings of Christ,
two commodities do grow vnto vs: the one, that al the
thinges that euer he hath don, for our profyt and behofe he
hath done them: so that they be as well oure owne, yf we Christes
will cleaue thearunto wyth stedfast and lyuely faith‚ as if we ffl‘lirnffsslgss’g
had done them oureselues. He was nailed to the crosse: we
wear also nayled with him: and in him oure synnes pu-
nished. He dyed: and was buryed: we lykewyse with our
sinnes are dead, and buried: and that in sutche sorte that
all remembraunee of our synnes is vtterly taken out of
mynde. He is risen again: and we are also risen again wyth
hym: that is, are so made partakers of hys rysyng againe
and lyfe, that from hensforth death hath no more rule ouer
vs. For the same spirit is in vs that raised vp J esus from
the deade. Finallye‚ as he is gonevp into heauenly glorye:
so are we lifted vp with hym. Albeit that these thynges do
not nowe appeare: yet then shall they all be broughte to
light, when Christ the lightc of the world, shal show him-
sclf in his glorye, in whome all oure blisse is layde vp in
