418 DOCTRINE OF THE TRINITY AND

beyond the beginning of the gospel, and that Christ, the
Word, was before John the Baptist's preaching?

Pr. I desire any one to read the text impartially, and he
will find the Socinian sense to be unnatural, forced, obscure,
and jejune, proving a thing of no moment at that time3 but
the sense we give, to be strong, weighty, consistent, and. of
very great consequence at that time, when the Cerinthians
denied the divinity of Christ. The sentences are short, the
words lofty and significant, the manner of beginning un-
usual3 so that any one would expect some great and extrae
ordinary matter to be said in these few verses; but what a
frustration were this, if after all they intended no more,
than that John Baptist preached in public before Christ,
yet that Christ was in being before that? Which is a sense
so mean, so remote from the occasion of his writing, as it is
delivered by the ancients, that nothing but a miserable ne-
cessity could make men of wit and subtilty to put such a
sense upon St= J ohn's words.

P. But they deny there was any such occasion of St.
J ohn's writing, as the Cerinthians⁷ heresy at that time.

Pr. I know Socinus doth so; but he might as well have
denied that there was any such person as Cerinthus. And
I think the Cerinthian heresy not only to have been the oc-
casion of St. J ohn's writing, but that the understanding of
it gives the greatest and truest light to the words of the
evangelist, shewing the force and importance of them.

P. Wherein, Ι pray, did that heresy consist?

Pr. I shall not meddle with other parts of it, but only
what relates to the present subject3 and that lay in these
things.

(1.) That there was a supreme and unknown Father‚
who was before the beginning, and therefore they called
him προαρχὴν, who was the fountain of all emanations. [ren.
lib. i. cap. 1. 19.

(2.) That the world was not made by him, but by a
power at a distance from him, called DemiurguS, Iren. l. i.
c. 25. And in the Egyptian school, where Cerinthus was
educated, the Λόγος, Word, was one of the intermediate
