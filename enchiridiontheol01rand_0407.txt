ΟΝ SCRIPTURE MYSTERIES. 89ss

follow if we attributed any thing corporeal to God; for,
then he must be compounded of parts, and so he may be
dissolved; then he must be confined to a certain place, and
not every where present3 he cannot have the power of act- χ
ing and sels-determining, which a mere body hath not. For
the clearest notion we can have of body is, that it is made
up of some things as parts of it, which may be separated
from each other, and is confined to a certain place, and bath
no power to move or act from itself. But some of these
men who cry down mysteries and magnify reason, to shew
how slender their pretences to reason are, have asserted a
corporeal God, with shape and figure. It was indeed well
thought of by those who would make a man to be God, to
bring God down as near to man as might be. But how to
reconcile the notion of a body with infinite perfections, is a
mystery to me, and far above my comprehension. But if it
be no mystery to such men, they must either deny God's
infinite perfectioris, or shew how a bodily shape can be ca-
pable of them. But some men can confound finite and in-
finite, body and spirit, God and man, and yet are for no
mysteries3 whereas these things are farther from our reach
and comprehension, than any of those doctrines which they
find fault with. But to proceed:

If we believe prophecy, we must believe God's fore-
knowledge of future events: for, how could they bc fore-
told if he did not foreknow them?> And if he did foreknow
those which he did foretel, then it was either because those
only were revealed to him, which is inconsistent with the
divine perfections; or that he doth foreknow all other
events, and only thought fitting to reveal these. But can
they solve these difficulties about divine prescience? Is there
no mystery in this? Nothing above their comprehension?

actions be foretold, God 'must be the cause of them, and
men will not be free agents in them. And yet it is most
certain, that the sufferings of Christ hythe wickedness of
