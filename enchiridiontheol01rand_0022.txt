summe: that is, that with al louing affection, we honour
and reuerence oure father and mother. That we kyll no
man. That we commit no aduoutrie. That we steale no-
thynge. That we beare false wytnes agaynst none. Last of
all that we couet nofflynge, that is oure neyghboures.

Master. How is that commaundemente‚ of the honor-
inge father and mother, to be vnderstanded?

Sekoler. Honoure of father and mother containeth Ioue,
feare, and reuerence, yea and it further standeth in obey-

require. It binedeth vs also moste humbly, and with most

Scholer. 1 shal shew you, as breifly as Ι haue done the

beguyle no man: to occupye no vnlawfull wares: to enuie
no man hys wealth: and to thynke nothing profytable, that
either is not iust‚ or differeth from ryghte and honestye:
