ter of them that thus doe answeare, will make the matter
plaine.

Nowe then you will saie, what kind of presence do they
graunt, and what do they denie? Briefelye they denie the
presence of Christes bodye in the naturall substance of his
humane and assumpte nature, and graunt the presence of
the same by grace. That is, they affirme and saie, that
the substance of the naturali bodie and bloud of Christ, is
onelie remainynge in heauen, and so shall be until] the lat-
ter daie when he shal come againe in glorie accompained
with the angelles of heaven, to iudge both the quicke and
the deade: And the same natural] substance of the verie
bodie and bloude of Christe, because it is united to the
divine nature in Christe, the seconde person of the Tri-
nitie, therfore it hath not onelye life in itselfe, but it is also
able and doth geue life unto so manie as bee or shall be
pai-takers thereos, that is, that to all that doo beeleue on
his name, which are not born of blond (as John saith) or
of the will of the fieshe, or of the will of man, but are borne
of God, though the selfe same substance abide still in hea-
ven, and they for the tyme of their pilgremage dwell here
upon the earth, by grace I saie, that is by the life men-
tioned in John, and the properties of the same, meete for
oure pilgremage here upon earth, the same bodie of Christe
is here presente with us: Even as for example wee saie,
the Sunne whiche in substaunce never removeth hys place
out of the heavens, is yet presente here by his beames,
light, and natural infiuence, where it shineth upon the earth.
For Gods worde and his Sacraments be as it were the

beames of Christ which is Sol J ustitiae, The Sunne of
righteousenes.

Thus thou haste hearde, of what sorte or secte soever
thou be, wherin doth stande the principali state and chiefe

â€™ pointe of all the controversies which doe properlie per-

teine unto the nature of this Sacrament: As for the use

therof I graunt ther be many other thinges wherof 1 have
spoken nothing.
