TRANSUBSTANTIATION. 99

And nowe 1 wil likewise rehearse the saiynges of other
three olde aunciente writers of the Lattin Churche, and soe
make an ende.

And first I will begin with Tertullian, whom Cypriane
the holy Martyr so highlie estemed that whensoeuer he
would haue his booke, he was wont to say, Geue vs now
the Master. This olde writer in his ΔΒΗ booke against
Martion the heritike, saith thus: J esus made the bread,
which he toke and distributed to his disciples, his body,
saiyng: This is my body, that is to say, (saieth Tertullian)
a figure of my bodie. In this place it is plaine, that after
Tertullians exposition, Christ ment not by calling the
bread his body, and the wine his bloude, that either the
bread was his natural bodie, or the wine his naturall bloude,
but he called them his bodye and his bloud, because he
would institute them to be vnto vs Sacramentes, that is
holie tokens and signes of his bodie, and of his blond, that
by them remembringe, and firmelie beleuing the benefites
procured to vs by his body, whiche was torne and crucified
for vs, and of hys bloude, whiche was shedde for vs vpon
the crosse, and soe with thankes receiuinge these holye sa-
cramentes, according to Christes institution, we myghte by
the same be spirituallie noryshed, and fedde, to thencrease
of all Godlines in vs, here in oure pylgremage and iorney
wherin we walke vnto euerlasting life.

This was vndoubtedlie Christe our Sauiours mynde, and
this is Tertullians exposition. The wranglynge that the
Papistes doe make to elude this saiynge of Tertullian, is
so far out of all frame that it enen wearieth me to thinke
on it.

Tertullyan writeth here, saye they, as none hath done
hitherto before him, neither yet anie other Catholike man
after him. This saiyng is to manyfest false: S. Augustine
and other olde awthors likwise doo call the Sacrament a
figure off Christs bodye.

And wher they„ saie, that Tertullian wrott this, when he
was in an heat off disputation with an heretike‚ coueting by
al ineanes to onercom his aduersarye: As who saye he
