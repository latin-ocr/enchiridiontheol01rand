Christ? If it be said, The case is not ahke, for those are
clearly revealed‚ and these are not; this brings it to the true
and proper issue of this matter, and if we do not prove a
clear revelation, we do not assert their being necessary arti-
cles of faith. But my present business was only to take off

this objection, that the mysteries were incomprehensible and
therefore not to be received by us.

ΙΙ. And so 'I come to the second way, by which we are
to examine the several senses of Christ J esus coming to save
simwrs: which of them tends more to the benefit and ad-
vantage of mankind; or which is more worthy of all oc-
reptation.

And that will appear by considering these things;

(1.) Which tends most to the raising our esteem and
love of Christ Jesus.

(2.) Which tends most to the begetting in us a greater
hatred of sin.

(3.) Which tends most to the strengthening our hope of
salvation by J esus Christ. ,

(1.) As to the raising in us a greater esteem and love of
Christ. We are certain that the infinite love and conde-
scension of Christ J esus in undertaking such a work as the
saving of sinners makes it most worthy of all acceptation.
Some men may please themselves in thinking, that, by
taking away all mysteries, they have made their saith more
easy; but I am certain they have extremely lessened the
argument for our love, viz. the apprehensions of the won-
derful love and condescension of Christ in coming into the
world to save simler-5. And yet this is the great argument.
of the New Testament to persuade mankind to the love of

speaks just before; but if no more be meant but only that
