body: nor of hys bodye a God.

Master. Ι see (my son) thou art not ignorant, after
what sorte Christe is rightlye sayd, to be from vs in bodye,
and with vs in spirit. But thys one thyng would I knowe
of thee: why Christ our Lord is thus conueied awaye from
the syghte of oure eyes: and what profit we take by his
goying vp to heauen.

Scholer. The chefe cause therof was, to plucke out of vs
that false opinion, whyche sometyme deceaued the apostles
theymselues: that Christ should in earth visibly reigne, as

thether‚ by dyuerse chaunge of chaunsable affayres. For
he could not be presentli with all at once, vnlesse hys body
weare so turned into Godheade‚ that he myght be in all or

heretykes helde opinion. If it so wear that he myghte be
