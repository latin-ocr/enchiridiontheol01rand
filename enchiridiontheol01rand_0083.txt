TRANSUBSTANTIATION. 69

bodye geuen for vs, and of his bloud shedde for the remis-
sion of sinnes.

But this remembraunce thus ordeined, as the awthor
thereos is Christ both God and man3 so by the allmighty
power of God, farre passeth all kind of remembraunces that
any other man is able to make, either of hymseffi or of any
other thing, for whosoeuer receueth this holye sacrament
thus ordeyned in remembraunce of Christ he receyueth
therwith either death or lyfe. In this I doo trust we all
agree. For Saincte Paule saith of the godlie receuers in the
tenth chapter of his first epistle to the Corinthians: The
cuppe of blessing which we blesse, is it. not the partaking or
fellowshipp of Christes bloud? And also he saieth: the
bread which we breake (and meaneth at the Lords table)
is it not the partaking or fellowshippe of Christes bodie?
Nowe the partakinge of Christes bodie and of his bloude
vnto the faithfull and godlie, is the partaking or fellowship
of life and of immortalitie. And againe of the bad and un-
godly receuers, St. Paule plainlie saieth thus. He that
eateth of this breade and drinketh of this cuppe vnworthily‚
he is gilty of the bodie and bloude of the Lorde. O howe
necessarie then is it, if we lone life and would eschewe
death, to trie and examine oureselues before we eat of this
breade, and drinke of this cuppe. For els assuredlie, he
that eateth and drinketh vnworthilie, eateth and drinketh
his own damnation, because he esteineth not the Lords
bodie, that is he receueth not the Lords bodie with the ho-
noure whiche is due vnto hym. And yet by that whiche
was saide, that with the receipte of the holie sacrament of
the blessed bodie and bloude of Christ, is receued of euerie
one good or hadde, either life or death; it is not meant that
they whiche are deade before God, hereby maie receiue life,
or the liuing before God, can herby receiue deathe. For
as none is meete to receiue natural] foode, wherby the na-
turall Iife is norished, excepte he be borne, and liue before;
so no man can feede, hythe receipte of this holie sacra-
mente, of the foede of cternall life, excepte hc bec rege-

nerated and borne of God before. And on the other side,
