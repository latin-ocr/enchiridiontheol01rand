ΟΝ ΤΗΕ TRINITY. 451

any new arbitrary explicatioris of my own upon other men’s
consciences; but confine myself wholly to the usual war-
ranted forms of expression. Ι will not wrest and strain scrip-
ture to help out a private notion, nor do any thing to be-
tray the just rights and privileges of our common reason;
but carefully endeavour to distinguish how far the doctrine
of the Trinity is a mystery, and how far a mystery may
become an object of saith: from whence I hope to make it
appear, that nothing hard or unreasonable is required of us

In order to which, Ι shall rank all my reflections upon
this subject under these three heads of inquiry:

I. What it is that perplexes and obscures our saith in
the Trinity.

ΙΙ. What is sufficient for Christians to believe concern-

III. What ill consequences can attend such a saith.

I. First then, I am to inquire, What it is that perplexes
and obscures our saith in the holy Trinity. For before I
enter upon a distinct and particular consideration of the
doctrine itself, it is necessary to point out some of the prin-

and ineffectual expositions of it. And they are these four:

The prejudice and bigotry of men indiscreetly pious.

The vanity and design of such as value themselves upon
inventing new notions‚ or laughing at the old ones.

The not discerning or considering the bounds and limits
of our knowledge.

And lastly, An imprudent choice of improper ways of
expression.

The two first of these have a general influence upon all
religious controversieS, but are more especially concerned
in this: for there is never more room for superstitious and
rigorous impositions, nor fairer advantages for cavilling, and
drawing absurd consequences, than where a mystery is the
subject of (lebate.

There are some who are apt to be concerned, and cry
out, as if the very foundations of all religion were over-
