ΟΝ ΤΗΕ ΤΒΙΝΙΤῩ. 463

what sense we can believe this proposition, that one and the
same God is three different Persons.

Now it is certain, that if those before specified are all the
notions we are able to frame of unity and distinction, then
God must be one and three in some way or manner there
laid down, or else in some other way or manner not con-
ceivable by human understanding.

First then, let us see how and in what manner God can
be one and three, according to those notions our souls have
framed of unity and distinction.

And here it is granted on all hands, that nothing can be
one and three in the same manner and respect: we cannot
conceive a thing to be in One determinate position, or ubi,
and in Three separate ubis all at once3 we cannot conceive
that One principle or nature should be but One, and yet
Three different principles or natures too3 or that any ob-
ject should be truly and adequately represented to any mind
or understanding under One idea, and truly and adequately
represented under Three different ideas. It is impossible
to believe any thing of this kind, because it implies a plain
contradiction to the clearest and most certain knowledge we
can have of unity and distinction; so that if one may be
three, in the same respect it is one, then one and three must
stand for other ideas than we conceive when we pronounce
these words; and if so, they ought to have other names,
and not be called one and three.

Since therefore we cannot say, that God is One and
Three in the same 1·espect; in the next place let us inquire,
in what different respects this may be affirmed of him.
-N ow, as to the unity of God, this is easily believed and ac-
knowledged, as being very agreeable to all our other notions
of the Deity. <The chief difficulty lies in assigning the dis-
tinction: in attempting which, the best and clearest way of

proceeding will be by going over the several kinds of dis-
tinction before mentioned.

I will begin with that of position: and here it is plain,
at first sight, that we cannot possibly conceive God under
any difference of positi0n3 we cannot exclude Omnipotence
