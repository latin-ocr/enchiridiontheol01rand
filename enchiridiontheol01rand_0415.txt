him divine attributes and honours; this were an argument

of great love to the person of Christ, but not to the rest of
mankind. But God's love in scripture is magnified with re-

spect to the world in the sending of his Son. In this was :John ino.
manffested, saith the apostle, tlte love of God towards us,
because that God sent lais only begotten 8οη into the world,

that we should lz've through him. Herein ‘is love, not that

¹ we loved God, but that lle loved us, and sent leis Son to be

a propitiation jor our sins. The great love we still see

is towards us, i. e. towards mankind3 but according to the

other sense it must have been, Herein was the love of God
manifested to his Son, that for his sufferings he exalted him

above all creatures. He that spared not Iris own Son, saith Rom-viii·3²-
St. Paul, but delivered lcimjor us all. If he were the eter-

force and emphasis in this expression, and very apt to raise

our admiration and our love; but what not §paring leis own

Son is there, if nothing were meant but that he designed by

’ sufferings to exalt him? For not sparing him supposes an
antecedent relation of the highest kindness, but the other is

only designing extraordinary kindness for the sake of his
suffering-S. Therefore the argument for the love of God is

taken from what his Son was, when he delivered him up for

us all: he was his own Son; not by adoption, as others

yet there was nothing extraordinary done by him, as to the

great design of his coming. Which shews, that there was

an antecedent relation between him and the Father3 and

that therein the love of God and of Christ was manifested‚

that, being the only begotten Son of tlte F ather, he should

take our nature upon him, and for our sakes do and suffer

what he did. This is indeed an argument great enough to

raise our admiration, to excite our devotion, to inflame our .
affection53 but how flat and low doth it appear, when it

comes to no more than this, that there was a man, whom,

after his sufferingS, God raised from the dead, and made
