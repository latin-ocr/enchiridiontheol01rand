ΟΝ SCRIPTURE MYSTERIES. 403

more to the begetting in us a due hatred of sin, than to con-
sider what Christ himself suffered on the account of it?
What can make us have more dreadful thoughts of it, than
that the great and merciful God, when he designed to save
sinners, yet would have his own Son to become a propiti-
ationjbr the sins of mankind ,9 And unless we allow this, we
must put force upon the plainest expressions of scripture;
and make Christ to suffer merely to shew God's power over
a most innocent person, and his will and pleasure to inflict
the most severe punishment without any respect to guilt.
And surely such a notion of God cannot be worthy (ff all
acceptat'ion.

tion by Christ J esus. If we believe that he suffered for our
sins, then we have reason to hope for the forgiveness of
them, although they have been many and great, if we

despair will be removed, which is taken from the justICe of
God, and his declared hatred of sin and displeasure against
sinners. If God be so much in ear-nest displeased with the
sins of mankind, and his justice be concerned in the punish-
ment of sinners, how can they ever hope to escape, unless
there be a way for his displeasure to be removed, and his
justice to be satisfied ? And this the scripture tells us is done Rom. v. 10.

consolation from the hopes of forgiveness of sins. Whereas,
if this be taken away, either men must believe that God was
notin earnest displeased with the sins of mankind3 which
must exceedingly lessen our esteem of the holiness and jus-
tice of God; or if he were so displeased, that he laid aside
his displeasure, without any atonement or sacrifice of expi-
ation. And so, as many as look on God's justice and holiness,
as necessary and essential attributes of God, will be in danger
of sinking into the depths of despair, as often as they refiect
seriously on the guilt of their sins. But on the other side,
if we believe that while we were enemim, we were reconcilccl
