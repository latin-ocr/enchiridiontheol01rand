ΟΝ ΤΗΕ TRINITY. 475

ship, peculiar to God only, to himself, if he had not been in-
fallibly conscious that of a truth God dwelt in him. Ι cannot
possibly conceive, that one, who declined all appearance of
grandeur, dominion, and authority, should have allowed of
any thing that looked like worship, or adoration, or might
have been mistaken for it, or that he, who knew he was be-
lieved to be the Son of God, in such a sense as some thought
blasphemy, would not have undeceived his followers, and
justified himself to his enemies, had he not really been what
it was blasphemy to have pretended to be if he were not.

I might easily pursue these reflections a great deal fur-
ther, and bring more arguments to confirm the truth of
what I have asserted, that these names or titles of F ather,
Son, and Holy Ghost, are applied in the scripture to the
one true God‚· but I judge it altogether unnecessary, not
only because it has been fully made out already in several
set discourses upon this subject, but because it is so plainly
and expressly revealed, that I am verily persuaded every
man that reads would believe, were it not for the additional
explications such a belief is charged with.

here lies the whole difficulty of the matter, the main stress
of the controversy. For that God should be called F ather,
Son, and Holy Ghost, is as easily to be believed, as that he
should be called Adonai, Elohz'm, and Jehovah: that the
same thing should be signified and expressed by several
names, is no such incredible mystery: but if we allow that
these terms, F ather, Son, and Holgy Ghost, are all applied
to God in scripture, it is not thought sufficient to say that
these are three several names which signify G0d‚· but we
are further required to believe that God is one and three,
the same God, but three dg'fferent hypostases or persons,-
and that one (ff these three hypostases or persons z‘s both
God and man. These are the hard sayings which puzzle
some men’s understandings, and make them choose rather
to wrest and pervert the plainest texts, than admit such
seemingly inconsistent consequences.

Here therefore I shall examine what grounds there arc
in scripture for such an exposition :
