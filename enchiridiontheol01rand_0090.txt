76 RIDLEY AGAINST

obedience‚ and submission of my judgment in this my
writing, and in 011 other mine affaires, vnto those of Christes
churche whiche bee truelye learned in Gods holye worde,
gathered in Christos name and guidcd by his spirite. After
this protestation I (100 plainelye afflrme and saie, that the
seconde aunsweare made to the chiese question and princi-
pal pointe I am perswaded to be the verye true meaning and
sense of Gods holie worde: That is, that the natural sub-
staunce of breade and wine, is the true material] substaunce
of the holie sacramente of the blessed bodie and bloude of
oure sauioure Christe.

And the places of scripture wherupon this my faithe is
grownded, be theis, both concernyng the Sacrament of the
bodye, and also of the bloud.

Fyrst lett us repete the begynning of the institution of
the Lords supper wherin 011 the three Evangelists and
St. Paul almost in wordes do agree, sayng that Jhesus
tooke bread, gave thankes, brak-e, and gaue to the Disci-
ples sayng, take eat, this is my bodye. Here it appereth
plainlye, that Christ calleth verye bread his bodye. For
that which he tooke was very bread-(in this all men doo
agre) and that which he tooke, after he had gyuen thankes,
he brake, and that which 110 tooke and brake, he gaue it
to his disciples3 and that whiche he tocke, brake, and gave
to his disciples, 110 sayd hymself of it: This is my bodye.
So it appeareth plainlye that Christ called verye bread his
bodye. But very bread 0011 not be his bodye in verye sub-
stance therof, therfore it muste nedes haue 011 other mean-
yng, whiche meanyng appeareth plainlye what it is, by the
nextc sentence that followeth immediatlie both in Lukc
and Paule, and that is this, Doo this in remembraunce of
me3 whervppon it seemeth vnto me to be euident, that
Christ dyd take bread, and called yt his bodye, for that he
wold institute therby, a perpetuali remembrance of his
bodye, specially of that singular benefyte of‘ our redemp-
tyon, whiche 110 wold then procuro and purchase vnto vs
by his bodye, vppon the crosse. But bread retayning still
his owne very natm-all substance, maye bc thus by grace,
