LXXVII. EvEnY minister is obliged publicly or p1'1-
vately to 1ead the common prayers every day m the week‚
at morning and evening3 and in great towns and populous
places conveniently inhabited, it must be read in churches,
that the daily sacrifice of prayer and thanksgiving may
never cease.

LXXVIII. The minister is to instruct the people, that
the baptism of their children ought not to be ordinarily de-
ferred longer than till the next Sunday after the birth of
the child3 lest importune and unnecessary ›delay occasion
that the child die before it is dedicated to the service of
God and the religion of the Lord J esus, before it be born
again, admitted to the promise of the gospel, and reckoned
in the account of the second Adam.

LXXIX. Let every minister exhort and press the peo-
ple to a devout and periodical communion, at the least three
times in the year, at the great festivals; but the devouter
sort, and they who have leisure‚ are to be invited to a fre-
quent communion3 and let it be given and received with
great reverence.

LXXX. Every minister ought to be well skilled and
studied in saying his office, in the Rubricks‚ the Canons,
the Articles‚ and the Homilies of the Church, that he may
do his duty readily, discleetly, gravely, and by the public
measures of the laws. To which also lt is vel y useful that
it be added, that every minister study the ancient canons of
the church‚ especially the Penitentials of the eastern and
western churches: let him read good books, such as are
approved by public authority3 such which are usefid, wise,
and holy; not the scribblings of unlearned parties, but of
men learnech pious, obedient, and disinterested3 and amongst
these, such especially which describe duty and good life,

which minister to saith and charity, to piety and devotion;
