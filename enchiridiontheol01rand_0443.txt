TRANSUBSTANTIATION COMPARED. 429

soul hath three faculties; understanding, will, and memory;
we may, without the least absurdity, say, there are three
and one; and those three not confounded with each other,
and yet there is but one soul.

P. But the Socinians object, that there is a difference
between three properties and three distinct persons; be-
cause a person is an individual being; and so three persons
must be three individual beings; and therefore as there is
but one divine Being, there can be but one Person.

Pr. This is the main strength of the cause3 to which I
answer, that although a person be an individual being, yet
it implies two things in it: (1.) Something common with
others of the same nature3 as three men have one and the
same nature, though they be three persons. (2.) Some-
thing peculiar and inconnnunicate to any other; so that
John cannot be Peter, nor Peter J ames.

P. But what is it which makes one not to be the other,
when they have the same common nature?

Pr. You ask a hard question, viz. about the principle of
individuation; but if it be so hard to resolve it, as to cre-
ated beings, there is certainly far less reason for us to be
unsatisfied, if it appear difficult to clear the differenee of
nature and person in an infinite Being. Yet all mankind
are agreed in the thing, viz. That there is a community of
the same nature, and a real distinction of persons among
men, though they cannot tell what that is which discrimi-
nates the human nature in John, from the same human
nature in Peter and J ames. And it is observable‚ that, as
beings arise in perfectiori above each other, it is still so
much harder to assign that which is called the principle of
individuation. In gross and material beings we can discern
a number of accidents, or peculiar modes and properffies,
which distinguish them from each other; but it is much
harder to assign it in spiritual and intellectual beings,
whose natures and differences lie not so open to our under-
standings. If so be then it appears more difficult in an in-
finite and incomprehensible Being, what cause have we to
wonder at it?
