TRANSUBSTANTIATION COMPARED. 433

with seorn and contempt reject it, and endeavour to bring
reproach upon Christianity for the sake of it, and disturb
the peace of the church about it; such cannot be said to re-
ceive or believe it faithfully, and by such sins they do run
the hazard of perishing everlastingly.

P. I see you have a mind to smooth every thing relating
to the Trinity3 I wish you would do the same about tran-
substantiation. But yet you have not answered the other
great difficulty in point of reason, viz. That those things
which agree or disagree in a third, must agree or disagree
with the other. And therefore if the Father be God, the
Son God, and the Holy Ghost God, then the Father must
be Son and Holy Ghost, and the Son and Holy Ghost
must be the Father. If not, then they are really the same,
and really distinct3 the same as to essence, distinct as to
persons; and so they are the same, and not the same, which
is a contradiction.

Pr. And now I think you have drawn out the most re-
fined spirits of Socinianism, to make the doctrine of the
Trinity and transubstantiation parallel, because you say, it
implies a contradiction, which is the nearest parallel you
have yet offered at. But this terrible argument is ground-
ed on the same supposition, viz. That the divine essence is
no more capable of communicating itself to three distinct
personS, than any created being is. The reason of that
axiom being, that created things, by reason of their finite nan
ture, cannot diffuse or communicate themselves to more than
one3 and therefore those which agree in a third, must agree
together3 but supposing it possible that the same finite na-
ture could extend itself to several individuals, it would be
presently answered, the axiom did hold only where they did
adequately and reciprocally agree, and not where they did
agree only in essenee, but differed in the manner of subsist-
ence. For where a different manner of subsistence is sup-
posed possible in the same individua] nature, the agreement
in that cannot take away that difference which is consistent

with it, which we attribute to the unlimitedness and perfec-
tion of the divine nature.
