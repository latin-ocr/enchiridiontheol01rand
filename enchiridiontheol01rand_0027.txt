THE CATHECHISME. 13

ryfye him: What canst thou say more of the begynning
and makyng of man?

Scholer. Euen that whyche Moses wrote: that God The mak
shaped the fyrste man of claye: and put into hym souleing Ο( ''¹³¹''
and life: then, that he cast Adam in a deade sleepe, and
brought foorth a woman, whome he drewe oute of hys
syde, to make her a companion with hym of al his life and
wealth. And therfore was man called Adam, because he she nan ο,
tooke hys beginning of the earth: and the woman called 5ἒὲῗῖ
Eue, because& she was appoynted to be the mother of al
liuing.

Master. What image is that, after the lykenesse whereof,
thou sayest that man was made?

Scholer. That 1s most absolute righteousnesse and per· 'irhe mnage
fect holynes: whyche moste nealely belongeth to the very 111113ζ1ᾶ1ὲ
nature of God· and most clearely appeared m Christ our aster.
new Adam. Of the whyche ln vs, thear scante are to be
seen any sparcles.

Master. What. Ρ are ther scant to be seen?

Scholer. It is true forsooth: for they do not now so Gods unago
shine, as they dyd 1n the begynning, before mans fall: for· (1 meac-edi ¹¹¹
asmuch as man by the darknesse of synnes, and myst of
ernours, hath corrupted the bryghtnesse of thys nnage. In
suche sorte hath God in hys wrathe wreaked hym vpon the
synful man.

Master. But I pray the tell me, wherefore came it thus
to passe?

Scholesr. l wyll shewe you. When the Lorde God had
made the frame of thys world, he hymselfe planted a gar-
den, full of delytc and pleasure, in a certaine place, east-
ward, and called it Eden. Wherein besyde other passyngc
fayre trees, not far from the myddes of the garden was
thear one specially called, the tree of lyfe, and another
called the tre of knowledge of good and euell. Herein the
Lord of his singuler loue placed man: and committed vnto
hym the garden to dresse, and looke vnto: geuynge hym
libertie to eate of the fruites of all the trees of paradysc‚
except the fruite of the tree of knowledge of good and eucll.
