TRANSUBSTANTIATION. 81

is so far from all reason butt he will grawnt me that this is
not likelye so to be. Nowe then if yow graunte me that
Paule dyd vse the forme of wordes whiche he writeth‚ let
vs then reherse and consyder Paules wordes, which he
saithe'Christ spake thus vppon the cuppe: This cuppe is
the newe testament in my bloud, this doo as often as ye
shall drinke it in the rernembraunce of me.

Here Ι wold knowe whether that Christes wordes spoken
vppon the cuppe were not as mightye in worke, and as ef-
fectuall in signification to all ementes, constructions, and
purposes (as our parlyament men doo speke) as they were
spoken vppon the bread: Yf this be grawnted, which
thinge Ι thinke no man denye, then further I reason thus:
But the worde (ys) in the wordes spoken vppon the Lordes
bread, doth mightelye signefye (saye they) the chaunge of
the substance of that which goeth before yt, into the sub-
stance of that which followeth after, that is, of the substance
of bread into the substance of Christes bodye, when Chryst
sayeth, This is my bodye. Nowe then if Christes wordes
whiche be spoken vppon the cupp, whiche Paule here re-
herseth, be of the same might and power, both in working,
and signefyinge, then must this word (ys) when Christ
saith, This cuppe is the newe testament, &c turne the sub-
stance of the cuppe into the substance of the newe testa-

ment.
And if thow willt saye that this word (ys) neither

maketh nor signefieth any suche chaunge of the cuppe, al-
thowgh it be sayd of Christ, that this cuppe is the newe
testament‚ yet Christ ment no suche chaunge, as that:
Mary, syr, euen so saye I, when Christ sayd of the bread
which he tooke, and after thankes giuen brake, and gaue
them, sayinge take, eate, This is my bodie; he meant no
more any suche chaunge of the substance of bread, into the
substance of his naturall bodye, then he meant of the
chaunge and transubstantiacion of the cuppe, into the sub-
stance of the newe testanient. And if thow wilt saye, that
the worde (cuppe) her in Christes wordes doth not signefye
the cuppe it self, but the wyne, or thinge conteyned in the
