102 RIDLEY AGAINST

wherein he dydde ordayne the Sacrament of hys bodye, as
all learned menne doe agree.

S, Augustine also in his Qsssd Epistle ad Bonifacium,
teacheth howe Sacramentes doe beare the names of the
thinges wherof they be sacraments, boeth in Baptisme, and
in the Lordes table. Euen as we call euerie good Fryday,
the daye of Christes passion; and euerie Easter day the
daie of Christes resurrection; when in verie dede there was
but one daie wherin he suffered, and one daie wherein he
rose. And why doe we then call them so which are not so
in dede, but because they are in like time, and course of
the yeare, as those dais were wherein those things wer done?
Was Christ (saeth S. Austin) offred any more but once?
and he offred himself.

And yet in a sacramente, or representation, not onely
euery solempne feast of Easter, but also euery daie, to the
people he is offered. For if sacramentes had not some si-
militude, or likenes of those things wherof they be sacra-
mentes, they could in no wise be sacramentes. And for
their similitudes‚ and likenes commenly they haue the names
of the thinges wherof they bee sacramenteS. Therfore, as
after a certaine manner of spech, the sacramente of Christes
bodie, is Christes bodie, the sacramente of Christes bloud‚
is Christes bloud‚ so likewise the sacrament of faith is
faith, &a

his questions Super Leuiticum, et contra Adimantum, it is
sayed in scripture that seuen eares of corne be seuen yeares,
seuen kyne be seuen yeares, and the rocke was Christe, and
bloud is the soule: The whiche laste saiynge (saieth S.
Austen) in his booke contra Adimantum, is vnderstanded
to be spoken in a signe, or figure, for the Lorde himselfe
did not sticke to saie, This is my bodie, when he gaue the
signe of his bodie.

For we muste not considre in sacramentes (saieth S. Au-
gustine 111 another place) what they be, but what they do
signih'e. For they be signes of things, being one thing in
themselues, and yet signifiyng another thing. For the hea-
