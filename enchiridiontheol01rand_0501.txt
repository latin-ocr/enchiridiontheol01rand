ΟΝ ΤΗΕ TRINITY. 487

obliged explicitly to believe, is no mystery; for whatever
terms Ι am bid to believe a thing in I cannot comprehend,
I can mean no more but that I believe it to be in some
manner I cannot comprehend: and I am sure there is no
difficulty or danger in believing that there are some things
which we are not able to find out or comprehend.

These are the reflections which offered themselves upon a
careful and impartial consideration of this subject. ,

But here I foresee it may be asked, What do we under-
stand more of the Trinity now than we did before? What*
new hypothesis is here advanced to solve all the difficulties

under any obligation of believing that particular exposition of
it: for besides the difficulty of such abstracted notions, even
in their plainest dress, with respect to mean capacities,
which are all equally concerned in necessary articles of faith,

more should be necessary to our salvation than was to
theirs: and it is certain, their faith was sufficient and ef-
fectual for obtaining eternal life, who could not possibly be-
lieve what we suppose to be lately discovered.

But ley, Considering that we are permitted with hu-
mility and reverence to exercise our souls in the search of
divine knowledge3 and moreover that we ought as Chris-
