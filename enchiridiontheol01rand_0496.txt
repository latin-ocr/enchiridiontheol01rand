short of expressing the riches and fulness of his mercy and
loving-kindness.

And the same use and spiritual improvement is to be
made of all other revelations of this nature.

And thus we have seen how far we are capable of con-
ceiving a Trinity, and what the scriptures expressly oblige
us to believe concerning this point.

All that is beyond, lies far out of our reach and compre-
hension, and no particular explicatioris can add any thing to
our faith; for the terms made use of for that end, being in
use before this doctrine was taught, must either signify the
same they did before, or not. If the same, where is the
mystery? If not, what do they signify? Something that we
cannot explain but in words used already, and then the
question will return again. The same difficulty would at-
tend new terms invented on purpose; for either they would
have no meaning at all affixed to them, 01· else they would
be understood in the sense of some other in use before.
And therefore, had the very same terms and forms of ex-
pression been found in the scriptureS, as are now in our
creeds, the revelation of the Trinity had been no plainer,
nor we obliged to believe any farther than the present lan-
guage does import: for upon a fair and distinct examina-
tion both of scripture and reason, it plainly appears, that
what is already revealed amounts to as much as we are ca-
pable of conceiving, and does besides imply something more
which we cannot comprehend3 and it is not in the power of
language to make us understand any thing better: for it is
utterly impossible to frame any notions above our own level.
And should God be pleased to stamp some new ideas upon
the minds of men, they could not be conveyed to others by
the help of words, or any other signs, but only by the same
divine impressions3 so that whatever ideas the apostles and
inspired writers might have of a Trinity by immediate in-
fusion, the tcrms they have made use of can give us but
this imperfect discovery of them, that they were such as we
are not able to comprehend without the like assistance.

This then is the utmost we are required to believe, or are*-
