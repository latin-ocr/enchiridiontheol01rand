oN THE TRINITY. 469

capable of conceiving, and at the same time freely acknow-
ledge, we do not know it so distinctly as it is capable of
being known.

For then only is the use of general abstracted terms to
be condemned, either when the subject we are upon will
admit of a more particular and sensible explication3 or, if
it will not, when, by too much refining and abstracting, we
deceive ourselves, and think some terms we have found out

And thus I have despatched the first branch of my main
discourse, wherein I proposed to consider how far it was
possible for us to believe a Trinity.

II. I come now to my second general inquiry, viz. What

Secondly, I shall endeavour to prove the truth of what 1
assert.

Thirdly, I shall consider the particular additional expli-
cations that have or may be given of the scripture account
of this article.

1. In speaking to the first, it must be allowed, that there
