474 BISHOP GASTRELL

large, if it had not been done already: but this being fully
insisted upon by others, I shall only name two passages to
this purpose; the one, Phil. iv. 13. the other, Acts vii. 59.
which, if there were no other, are of themselves sufficient
to shew what the saith of the first Christians was: for who,
but one that believed that Christ was God, could say with
St. Paul, I can do all things through Christ that strength-
eneth me ; or with St. Stephen, at the instant of death, cry
out, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!

From these, and many other texts, it seems plain to me,
that Christ was worshipped, and acknowledged as God;

false worship being a thorough disproof of the authority
that commands it.

Christ Jesus, the Son ‘ff David according to the flesh, is re-
presented by all the evangelists as having his conversation
in this world with all lowliness and humility‚ and with per-
fect holiness and unblamableness of life: and it is not ima-
ginable, that a person of this character should have suffered
any titles to have been given him, any honour or respect to
have been paid him, which were not strictly and indispensa-
bly due to him; much less have taken the honour and wor-
