have of God, of unity and identity, distinction and number,
and person.

As to the notion of a Deity, it is true indeed I have not
a full and adequate idea of God, neither is my soul capable
of it3 but what conceptions I have of his nature and per-
fections are, according to my apprehension, so far clear, as
to enable me truly and justly to determine which of those
distinct ideas I have in my mind are applicable to him, and
which are not. And such a knowledge of the divine na÷
ture as this is a sufficient direction of my faith in any pro-
position concerning God, where Ι clearly understand all the
ideas attributed to him.

In the next place therefore, I am to consider what no-
tions I have of unity and identity, distinction and number.

And here I confess I am at a loss how to deliver myself,
these being some of our first and most simple ideas, which
are so clear of themselves, that I cannot find clearer to ex-

self that he has a power of perceiving and comparing his
perceptionS, and consequently must know, when any thing
is presented to his mind, whether it be perceivable at one

ideas, when the same appearances are repeated again, and
how often the representation is varied.

However, notwithstanding the clearness of these notions
with respect to what passes in our own ininds, we are not
able to make true and distinct judgments of the unity or
multiplicity of things without us: for it does not follow,
that what is represented to the soul at once, under one idea
or appearance, should, according to the reality of things, be
one undivided nature; neither can it be inferred, that what
is represented to the soul under different ideas is so many
distinct real beings: for there are some ideas purely of the
soul's own making, and not copied from any externa] pat-
tcrns; where there are a great many particular real beings,
of different kinds and natures, comprehended under one re-
