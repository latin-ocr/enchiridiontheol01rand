TRANSUBSTANTIATION. 83

the spech is figuratiue. And for example he bringeth the
saying of Christ in the 6ὼ Chapter of Sainct J hon. Except
ye eate the fleash of the sonne of man and drinke his bloud,
ye canne not haue life in you. It seameth to commaund a
wicked or an ungodlye thing, wherfore it is a figuratiue
speache, commaundinge to haue communion and felowshippe
with Christes passion, and deuoutelye and wholesomelie to

laie vp in memorie, that his fleashe was crucified and
wounded for vs.

And here Ι can not but maruaile at some men, surelye
of muche excellente finesse of witte, and of greate eloquence,
that are not ashamed to write and saie that this aforesaide
sayinge of Christe is (after Saint Austen) a figuratiue
speach in dede, but not vnto the learned, but vnto the vn-
learned; here lette any man that indifferently vnderstandeth
the latten tongue, reade the place in St. Austen, and if he
perceiue not clearlye St. Austens woorcles and minde to be
contrarie, let me abide therof the rebuke.

This lesson of St. Austen 1 have therfore the rather sette
forth, because as it teacheth vs to vnderstande that place in
J hon figuratiuelye, euen soe suerlye the same lesson with
the example of St. Austens exposition theros teacheth VS,
not only by the same to vnderstande Christes wordes in the
institution of the Sacrament both of his bodie, and of his
bloud figurafively, but also the very true mening and under-
standing of the same. For if to commaund to eate the fleashe
of the sonne of man, and to drinke his bloude, seemeth to
commaunde an inconuenience, and an vngodlines, and is
even so in dede, if it be understanded as the wordes do
stand in their proper signification,and therfore muste be
vnderstanded figuratively and spirituallye, as St. Augustin
doth godlie, and learnedlie interpretate them: Thon suerlie,
Christe commaundinge in his last supper to eate his body,
and to drinke his bloud, semeth to commaund in sound of
words, as great and even the same inconvenience and vn-
godlines as did his woordes in the 6th. Chapiter of St. John,
and therfore inuste euen by the same reason be likewise vn-
derstanded and expounded figuratiuelye and spirituallic, as·
