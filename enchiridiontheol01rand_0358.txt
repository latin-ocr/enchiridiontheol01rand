344 BISHOP TAYLOR'S ADVICE

space without business, that space is the proper time for
danger and temptation3 and no man is more miserable than
he that knows not how to spend his time.

XXXVI. Fear no man’s person in the doing of your
duty wisely, and according to the laws: remembering al-
ways, that a servant of God can no more be hurt by all the
powers of wickedness, than by the noise of a fly's wing‚ or
