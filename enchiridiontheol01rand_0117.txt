TRANSUBSTANTIATION. 103

uenly breade (saieth he) speakinge of the 536131116111311
breade, by some maner of speach is called Christes bodye‚
when in verye dede it is the sacrament of the bodye, &c

What can be more plaine, or more clearely spoken, then
are theis places of SfAugustine before rehersed, if men
were not obstinately bent to mainteyne an vntrewth, and to
receiue nothing what so 61161 (10111 5611 11 fourth.

Yet one place more of S. Augustine will 1 alledge which
is verie cleare to this purpose, that Christes naturall bodye
is 111 116311611, and not here corporally in the sacrament, and
so lett him depart.

In his 5οῖΪῙ Treatyse which he writeth uppon J hon he
teacheth plainly, and clearlie, howe Christ being both God
and man, is both here after a certaine maner, and yet in
heauen, and not here in his naturall bodye and substaunce
which he tooke of the blessed virgine Marie, speking thus
of Christ and saing: By his diuine maiestye, by 1115 proui-
dence, by his vnspeakable and inuisible grace, that is ful-
filled which he spake ε Behold I 3111 with yow vnto the ende
of the worlde. But as concerning his fleash, whiche he
tooke in his incarnation, as towching that which was born
of the virgine, as concerning that which was apprehended
by the J ewes, and crucified vppon a tree‚ and taken downe
from the crosse, lapped in lynen clothes, and buryed and
rose agayn, and appeared after his resurrection, 35 601166111-
ing that fleash he sayed, Ye shall not euer haue me with
yow. Why so? For as concerning his fleashe he was con-
uersaunt with his disciples 40 dayeS, and they accompany-
ing, seing, and not following him, he went vpp into heauen
and is not here. By the presence of his diuine maiestie he
did not depart, as concerning the presence of his divyne ma-
iestie we haue Christ euer with vs, but as concerning the
presence of his fleash he said truly to his disciples, ye shall
not euer haue me with yow. For as concerning the presence
of 1115 fleashe, the church had him but-a fewe dayes, nowe
yt holdeth him by fayth, thowgh it seeth him not.

Thus much S. Augustine speketh repeting one thing so
oftc, and all to (1661316, and teach, howe we should vnder-

stand the maner of Christos being herc with vs, which 15111ν
