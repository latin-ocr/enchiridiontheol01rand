86 RIDLEY AGAINST

ye will knowe what it doth shewe or demonstrate, whether
tho broad that Christ toke or no; he answereth no, but only
one thing in substance it pointeth‚ wherof the nature or
name it doeth not tell, but leaveth that to be determined
and told by that which foloweth the word (is) that is by
predicatum, as the Logician doeth speke, and therfore he
calleth this pronowne demonstratiue (this) indiuiduum va-
gum, that is a wanderynge proper name, whereby we maie
pointe out and shew any one thing in substance, what thing
soeuer it be.

Marke, the pronowne demonstratiue (this) doeth not wan-
der to poynte out onelie one thynge in substaunce‚ not
shewyng what it is, but telleth it plainelie what it is, no lesse
in Mathewe and Marke to the eye, then is done in Luke

and Paul, by putting to this word (euppe), boeth vnto the
eye, and vnto the eare.

For taking the cuppe, and demonstrating 01· shewing it
