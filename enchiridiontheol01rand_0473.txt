presentation: thus all the hills, plains, rivers, trees, and
towns, &a which the eye can reach from such or such a
point, we put into one picture, and call it a landscape, or
prospect. Thus does the soul enlarge its view to all the
works of G-od and nature; it takes in the whole creation at
a thought, and calls it world. On the other side, the real
nature and essences of things, which are allowed to consist
in a simple undivided unity, are not conceivable by us at
once, but at different views, by different partial conceptionS,
which the soul afterwards compounds and calls by one
name. Thus when we endeavour to comprehend the na-
ture and essence of what we call mem, we form, at different
times, several confused notions of substance, body, life,
sense, and reason; every oue of which is a complicated idea,
and to be resolved into a great many others more simple
and distinct: as for instance, I must form a great many
ideas of particular actions, and the modes, differences, and
relations of them, before I can have any tolerable know-
ledge of what reason is; and so for the rest.

All therefore that we understand of the unity of things
without us, is this: when we perceive any object in a con-
tinued position, bounded and fenced out from other things
round about it, all within such terms and limits we call
osne: and then again, observing a great many different
actions, produced in and by such an object, we judge all
these actions and operations to proceed from one common
principle, in some such manner as streams from a fountain,
or several lines from the same centre. And whatever we
thus judge to be oue, though a great many thoughts and
conceptions go to the forming of such a judgment, we en-
deavour, as well as we can, to represent to ourselves, under
one idea οι· appearance, though the representation be often
very confused and indistinct. And this we do, as supposing
it wholly and uniformly conceivable at one single view,
were it not for the imperfection of our faculties: which
suppositionis not without good ground ς’ for this we have
plain experience for, that when any object is of such a
magnitude, or in such a situation that the eye cannot re-
