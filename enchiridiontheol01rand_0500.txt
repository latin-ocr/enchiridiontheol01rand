486 BISHOP GASTRELL

3. But thirdly, it is further objected, that though the
doctrine of the Trinity, as we explain it, could not be
proved to eontain downright contradictions3 yet at least
' it must be counted and esteemed as a mystery, and the im-
position of mysteries for articles of saith is a thing of very
ill consequences.

In answer to which charge, it is to be observed, that as in
the doctrine of the Trinity, so in most other objects of saith
and knowledge, there is something that we plainly and cer-
tainly understand, and something that we cannot possibly
comprehend: thus a man by inward reflection is infallibly
conscious of his own thoughts, and he judges whatever he
perceives within himself to proceed from one common prin-
ciple, which he calls his soul; and which, from the nature
of its operations‚ he is fully persuaded is something of a
different kind from his body, though it always acts in con-
sent with it: but what this soul is, or in what manner united
to his body, he is not able to conceive3 and therefore the
doctrine of the human soul, taken all together, may as justly
be styled a mystery, as the Trinity. We ought not then to
be offended at the word mystergy,· since, if we strictly exa-
mine our thoughts, we shall find that almost every thing we
pretend to know comes under that name, even those things
we have the greatest assurance of, our very souls and beings.

This being observed, we may consider the Trinity either
with respect to what may be understood of it, or what can-
not: so far as we are capable of conceiving a Trinity, it is
no mystery, and consequently no oppression of our saith,
and so far as it cannot be comprehended, it does not bind⁴
us to any explicit act of faith; as is plain from what has
been said before concerning the nature of saith, and the
persons obliged to believe this article: for all things neces-
sary to salvation are to be believed by all sorts of men, and
nothing can be believed any farther than the terms in which
it is proposed are understood: but a mystery cannot be
brought down to the lowest capacities, and be delivered in
tei-ms that are plainly and distinctly understood, for then it
would be no longer a mystery: so far therefore as we are
