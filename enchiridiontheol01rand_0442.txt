428 DOCTRINE OF THE TRINITY AND

tinction of one from another, either by some outward ap-
pearance, as a vizard or habit, or some particular quality or
disposition. And from hence it came to be applied to those
inward propertieS, whereby one intelligent being is distin-
guished from another; and from those properties, to the
person who had them. Thus person is used even by Tully
himself at least twenty times in his books of Rhetoric;
and the old civil law speaks of persoozal rights and per-
sonal actions. So that the critics, such as Valla, and others,
had no cause to find fault with Boethius for applying the
notion of a person to an “intelligent being subsisting in
‘⁶ itself,” (and so the soul is no person in men, but the man
consisting of soul and body,) “ having some incommunica-
“ ble properties belonging to him :⁵³ therefore I cannot but
wonder at the niceness of some late men, who would have
the names of person, and hypostasis, and Trinity, to be
laid aside, since themselves confess Boethius his definition
of a person to be true enough3 but they say, “it belongs to
‘⁶ the creatures, and not to God, for it would make three
‘⁶ Gods.'⁵ Which is to suppose, without proving it, that the
divine nature can communicate itself after no other manner
than a created nature can.

This is now to be more strictly inquired into. And it is
very well observed by Boethius, de Trin. l. i. Principium
pluralitatis alteritas est.- “ That diversity is the reason of
‘⁶ plurality:” and therefore in the Trinity, so far as they
are different, they are three, i. e. in regard of personal pro-
perties and relations; but so far as they agree, they are but
ΟΝ E, that is, as to the divine nature. ’

It is very true, that, according to arithmetic‚ three can-
not be one, nor one three; but we must distinguish between
the bare numeration and the things numbered. The repe-
tition of three units certainly makes three distinct numbers;
but it doth not make three persons to be three natures.
And therefore, as to the things themselves, we must go
from the bare numbers, to consider their nature. Wherever
there is a real distinction, we may multiply the number,
though the subject be but one. As, suppose we say the
