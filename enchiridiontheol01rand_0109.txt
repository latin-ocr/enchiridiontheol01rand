TRANSUBSTANTIATION. 95

in this place neuer fault was founde with him vnto these
oure daies.

And whether this authour were J hon Chrisostome 111111-
selfe the Arehbishoppe of Constantinople, or no, that is not
the matter3 for of al it is graunted, that he was a writer of
that age, and a man of greate learninge. Soe that it is nia-
uifest‚ that this which he writeth, was the reeeiued opinion
of learned men in his daies, or els vndoubtedly in suche a
matter his saiyng should haue bene impugned, of some that
wrote in his time, or nere vnto the same.

Nay saith another, if this solution wil not serue, we maie
saie that Chrysostome did not speak of the vesseles of the
Lordes cuppe, or suche as was then vsed at the Lordes table,
but of the vesselles vsed in the temple in the olde lawe.

This answere will serue no more then the other. For
here Chrysostome speaketh of suche vesselles, wherin was
that whyehe was called the bodye of Christ, although it was
not the true body (saith he) of Christe, but the misterie of
Christes bodie. Now of the vesselles of the olde lawe, the
writers doe vse no suche maner of phrase: For their saeri-
fiees were not called Christes bodie, for Christe then was
but 111 shadows and figurs, and not by the sacrament of his
bodie, reuealed.

Erasmus whiche was‘a man that coulde vnderstand the
wordes and sense of the writer, although he woulde not be
500110 to speake againste this error of transubstantiation be-
cause he durste not, yet in his time declareth plainlie, that
this saiyng of this writer, is none otherwise to be vnder-
standed.

Yet can I, saith the thirde Papist, finde out a fine aud a
subtill solution for this place, and graunt all that yet is
saido, both alowing here the writer, and also that he mente
of the vesselles of the Lordes tables: For, saith he, the
body of Christe is not conteined in them at the Lordes table,
as 111 a place, but as in a misterie. Is not this a pretie
shefte, and a mistical solution? But by the same solution

then Christs bodie is not in the Lordes table, nor 111 the

priestes hande, nor in the pixe, and soe 110 15 here 11ο where.
