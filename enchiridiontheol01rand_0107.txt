TRANSUBSTANTIATION. 93

Lordes table, which is called of Origene, the typicall, and
symbolicall bodie of Christe.

The seconde of the two newe founde answeres‚ is yet
moste monstrous of all other, whiche is this. But let vs
graunt (saie they) that Origene spake of the Lordes sup-
per, and by the matter thereos was vnderstanded, the ma-
terial] substaunce of breade, and wine. What then, saie
they? for though the materiall substaunce was once gone,
and departed by reason of transubstantiation, whileste the
formes of breade and wyne did remaine, yet nowe it is no
inconuenience to saie that as that material] substaunce did
depart at the entryng in of Christes bodie vnder the afore-
said formes, soe when the saide formes be destroied, and
doe not remaine, then commeth againe the substance of
bread and wine, and this (saie they) is verye meete in this
misterie, that that which began with miracle, shal ende in a
miracle. Yf I hadde not red this phantasie, Ι would
scarselye haue beleued, that any learned man euer would
haue set furth suche a folish fantasie, which not onely lack-
eth all ground either of Gods word, reason, or of anie an-
ciente writer, but is also cleane contrarie to the commen
rules of schoole diuinitie, whiche is, that no miracle is to be
affyrmed and putte withoute necessitie. And although for
their former miracle‚ whiche is their transubstantiation, they
haue some collour, though it be but vaine, saynge it is doone
by the power, and vertue, of these woordes of Christe, This
is my bodie, yet to make this second miracle, of returning
the material substaunce againe, they haue no colloure at all.
Or els I pray them shew me, by what wordes of Christe, is
that seconde miracle wrought.

Thus ye maie see that the sleigthes and shiftes whiche
crafte and witte can inuente to wreste the true sense of Ori-
gene can not take place. But now lette vs heare one other
place of Origene, and soe we shall lette him goe.

Origene in the 11τὴ Homelye Super Leuiticum, saeth
that there is also euen in the fower gospelles, and not onely
in the old Testamente a letter, meanynge a litteral] sense,
whiche kylleth, for if thowe followe the letter (saieth he) in
