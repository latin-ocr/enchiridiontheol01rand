to be a fizitlffiul Sayz‘ng‚ till they gave sufficient evidence of
their authority from God, by the wonderful assistance of
the Holy Ghost. But now this faitlfful saying is contained
in the books of the New Testament, by which we are to
judge of the truth of all Christian doctrines. And when
two different senses of places of Scripture are offered, we
