may require any thing from us, which it is reasonable for
us to do; if it be then reasonable for us to give assent
where the manner of what God hath revealed is not com-
prehended, then God may certainly require it from us.
Hath not God revealed to us, that in six days Ite made
heaven and earth, ancl all that is theo-ein? But is it not reae
sonable for 115 to believe this, unless we are able to compre-
hend the manner of God's production of things? Here we
have something revealed, and that plainly enough; viz. that
God created all things,· and yet, here is a mystery remain-
ing as to the manner of doing it. Hath not God plainly
revealed that there shall be a resurrection of the dead? and
must we think it unreasonable to believe it, till we are able
to comprehend all the changes of the particles of matter
from the creation to the general resurrection? But it is said,
that there is no contradiction in this, but there is in the
mystery of the Trinity and Incarnation. It is strange bold-
ness in 111611 10 talk thus of monstrous contradictions in
things above their reach. The atheists may as well say,
infinite power is a monstrous contradiction3 and God’s im-
mensity and his other unsearchable perfectioris are mon-
strons paradoxes and contradictions. Will men never learn
to distinguish between numbers and the nature of things?
For three to be one is a contradiction in numbers3 but whe-
ther an infinite nature can communicate itself to three dif-
ferent subsistences without such a division as is among cre-
ated beings‚ must not be deterlnined by bare numbers, but
by the absolute perfections of the divine nature; which
must be owned to be above our comprehension.

For let us examine some of those perfections which are
most clearly revealed‚ and we shall find this true. The
scripture plainly reveals‚ that God is fi-om everlastz‘ng to
everlasting ; that he was, and is, ancl is to come ,- 11111 shall
we not believe the truth of this till we are able to fathom
