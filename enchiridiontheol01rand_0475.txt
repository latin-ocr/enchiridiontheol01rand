ΟΝ THE TRINITY. 461

we call spiritual beings, the other to material: for it is cer-
tain the conception we have of body can never furnish us
with any idea of simple unity‚

By a spirit then we mean something without extension,
and consequently indivisible, capable of performing some
such kind of actions, which do, in some manner or degree,
resemble those we are conscious of: but what that is, from
whence I suppose such actions do proceed, I have not the
least conception of ς for all that I conceive is only several
ideas of different particular actions, which no more express
the idea of that principle from whence they spring, than
the ideas of several particular lines express the idea of that
point they are drawn from.

All that we can perceive or imagine of corporeal unity‚
is nothing else but a connection or joint position of several
bodies, which, according as it is more or less perceivable,
according to the simplicity or multiformity of the figure
resulting from it, and the easiness or difficulty of separation,
makes several degrees of union, which all receive the com-
mon denomination of mzitgy.

Now as extension‚ by reason of its perpetual divisibility,
cannot give us a true notion of simple unity‚ so neither can
we have any distinct knowledge of union or composition,
abstracted from all considerations of extension. We do not
understand how a mind and body are united, any otherwise
than that we perceive such and such spiritual actions pro-
duced within the compass of such a body which we call
oue: neither are we able to comprehend the union or se-
paration of two spiritual beings, without considering them
as in the same or different localities; for we have not
distinct ideas of any different spiritual natures, nor, if
we should perceive a great many operations of several spi-
rits, could we distinguish the several individua] beings or
principles they proceeded from: for who is there that, if
all the thoughts and motions of the souls of several men
were communicated to him, could tell which proceeded
from which? Nay, we cannot tell what difference of actions
is sufficient to determine the different kinds of principles
