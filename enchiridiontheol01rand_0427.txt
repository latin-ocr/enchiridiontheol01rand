TRANSUBSTANTIATION COMPARED. 413

’ then relate to acts of the mind, but to outward acts of ado-

ration in the church.

Pr. erre the Gentiles guilty of idolatry in that respect,
or not?

P. Yes3 but not those, whom God requires to worship
in such a manner.

Pr. Then the sin of Gentile idolatry lay only in giving
divine worship to a creature without God's command3 which
lessens it to that degree, as to make will-worship and idola-
try the same; and to blame the apostleS‚ for making such a
dreadful sin of it, and dissuading Christians so much from

returning to the practice of it: for they had the privilege Romi. 21,

of giving divine worship to a creature by God's command,
which others were damned for doing without a command3
which makes the Christian religion not to appear so reason-
able, as the Anti-Trinitarians contend it is. But here are
four foul mistakes in point of reason, which they are guilty
of. (1.) In making the sin of idolatry so arbitrary a thing;
which depends not on the nature of the object which is
worshipped, but on the wil] and pleasure of God. (2.) In
making the Gentiles guilty of a great sin, merely in wanting
a divine command, which was out of their power. (3) In
making the Christian religion to set up the worship of a
creature, when its design was to root out idolatry. (4.) In
making a· factitious god, or a creature to be advanced to
the throne of God. Which I think is far more contradic-
tious to reason, than a Trinity of Persons in the unity of
the same nature. For nothing can be more absurd than to
make that to be God, which wants all the essential attri-
butes and perfections of God3 as every creature must do:
such as sels-existence, eternity, independence, immensity,
omnipotency, &c What a contradiction is it, to suppose a
weak, impotent, depending, confined, created God? and
such every creature must be in its nature, or else it is no
creature. I do not at all wonder to find the Socinians, after
this, to lessen the natural knowledge of God, and his infi-
nite perfections, both as to power and knowledge; for it was
their concernment to bring the notion of God as low as pos-
