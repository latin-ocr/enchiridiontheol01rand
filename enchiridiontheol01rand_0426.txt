412 DOCTRINE OF THE TRINITY AND

the Father, John v. 23. Let all the angels of God worship
him, Heb. i. 6. Blessing, (md honour, and glory, and power,
be mtto him that sittetlc on the throne, and to the Lamb jbr
ever and ever, Rev. v.13. That at the name ofJesus every
leswe shall bow, ‘ff things z'n heaven, and things in earth,
&c. Phil. ii. 9. If it were God's great design, by the Chris-
tian doctrine, to restore in the world a due sense of the in-
finite distance between God and his creatures; could any
thing be more repugnant to it, than in the same doctrine to
advance a participation of the same divine honour with him-
self? So that in plain truth, the idolatry of the world lay
only in a bad choice of the creatures they were to worship,
and not in giving div‘ine worship to a creature; for that
Christianity itself not only allows but requires, on suppo-

ginally a creature as we are. But Ι pray observe the force
of the apostle's argument, speaking of the Gentile idolatry3
hc saith it lay in this, leat they did service unco them
which by natare are no gods, Gal. iv. 8.

than trulgy and really, i. e. God did not advance those crea-
tures among the Gentiles to that worship and honour, which
he had done Christ.

Pr. Then you make it lawful by the gospel to believe
Christ to be a mere creature, and at the same time to give
him divine worship, which supposes him not to be a crea-
ture3 and so you must believe him to be a creature and
not to be a creature at the same time.

P. How do you make that appear?

Pr. From your own words; for you say, proper divine
worship lies in a due esteem of God in our minds, as the first
cause and last end, and in actions agreeable theret03 then to
give divine worship to God, we must believe him to be above
‚all creatures as to his nature and being; and therefore to
give Christ divine worship, must imply our believing him
not to be a creature and to bc a creature at the same time.

P. But thc meaning of divine worship here must not
