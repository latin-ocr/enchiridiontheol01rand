the heade: and haue one spirit, fayth, sacramentes, prayers,
forgiuenesse of sinnes, and heauenly blisse, common among
them all: and⁴ be so knyt with the bond of loue, that they
endeuour· themselues in nothyng more, than eche to help
other, and to build together in Christ.

Master. Seynge thou haste already spoken of the know-
ledge of God, and his members: I woulde also heare, what
is the true seruyce of God?
