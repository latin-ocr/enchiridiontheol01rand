TRANSUBSTANTIATION COMPARED. 419

emanations between the Father and the Demiurgus, Iren.
l. i. c. 23.

(3.) That this world was in a state of darkness and confu-
sion, as to the supreme Father of all; only some few had
some beams of light from him, by which they knew him.

(4.) That J esus was a mere man, born as other men are,
of J oseph and Mary, but of extraordinary goodness, wis-
dom, and sanctity.

(5.) That the supreme Father at his baptism did send
down a divine power upon him, in the shape of a dove,
which enabled him to declare the unknown Father, and to
work miracles, which returned to its own πλήρωμα, or ful-
neSS above, when J esus suffered.

This is a short scheme of that heresy, as delivered by the
ancient Fathers. And now let any one compare St. J ohn's
words with it; and he will find his design was to counter-
mine this heresy by two things,

(1.) That the Λόγος, Word, was eternal. For the Cerin-
thians said, the Λόγος was not in the beginning, but made a
great space of time between the eternal being of the Fa-
ther, and the emanation of the Λόγος, wherein he was in
perfect silence, as Irenaeus expresses it, (l. i. c. 1.) And so,
in the beginning, doth imply the eternity of the Word.
But that is not all; for he saith, ὀί was with God, and was
God, and was the Demiurgus, or the maker of the world,
and the revealer of God to mankind, John i. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9,
10. And so there was no place for those several emana-
tions between God and the Λόγος, and DemiurgUS, as the
Cerinthians said. ¹

(2.) That the Λόγος, or IVord, was incarnate, which he
affirms, ver. 14. And the Word was made fleslz, and dwelt
among· us, διο. and was the only-begotten Son of tlte Fa-
mer,- and so he not only cuts off the other emanations, but
declares that J esus was far from being a mere man. And· to
this purpose he brings in the testimony of John Baptist,
ver. 15. and applies what he had said to the person of J e-
sus Christ, ver. 17. Now this being St. John's design,
his words afford a demonstration to us of the union of the
