468 BISHOP GASTRELL

As for instance; suppose a blind man has a desire to
know what colour is3 it is certain he can never form a true
distinct idea of it; but yet heis capable of a general con-
fused knowledge, which wants but one degree of particu-
larity to be clear and perfect conception. He may know
that colour is not any substance, but some mode or determi-
nation which owes its existence and support to some other
being3 that it is not extension, or any other accident or qua-
lity perceivable by any of the senses he enjoys: he may fur-
ther be made to understand, that it is some kind of sensae
tion, produced by the impression of other bodies upon that
part of a man we call the eye, which other men perceive,
though he does not. Now it is plain that such a man
knows a great deal of the nature of colour, more by far than
any other blind man who has not made the same inquiries
and reflections about it; and so much as will secure him
from having any other idea imposed upon him for that of
colour, which is so distinguished and circumstantiated to
him, that, should he now receive his sight, he would pre-
sently acknowledge the marks before described to him: and
yet after all, it may be truly said, while he continues blind,
that he has no manner of idea of colour, because he has no
distinct idea of that particular kind of sensation to which
his general ideas are applied: and therefore he can go no
lower in his explications of the notion he has of colour: for
if he explains it by any sensation which he receives from his

other senses, the ideas he has then in his mind are indeed '

more particular and distinct, but the judgment he makes
upon them‘ must be utterly false3 whereas before, his know-
ledge was only general and confused, but yet true.

I have made choice of this plain, familiar instance of
sense, to shew the unreasonableness of those who in higher
speculations complain that the terms brought to explain
them are too general and abstracted; and demand a further
explication of what we cannot possibly know beyond such a
degree of particularity, which the terms already made use of
do express.

In vain therefore, and unjustly, are we urged to explain
the doctrine of the Trinity more particularly, when we
