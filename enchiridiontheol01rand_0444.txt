430 DOCTRINE OF THE TRINITY AND

But we must always make a difference between what we
have reason to believe, and what we have a power to con-
ceive. Although we have all the reason in the world to be-
lieve that there is a God, i. e. a Being infinite in all perfec-
tions; yet we must yield, that his essential attributes are
above our comprehension. As for instance:

(1.) We must believe God to be eternal, or we cannot
believe him to be God; for if he once were not, it is im-
possible he should ever be; and therefore we conclude ne-
cessary existence to be an essential attribute of the divine
nature: but then, how to conceive that a being should be
from itself, is at least as hard, as how one and the same in-
dividual nature should be communicated to three distinct
persons3 nay, it is somewhat harder, since we see some-
thing like this in other beings, but we can see no manner of
resemblance of a thing that hath its being wholly from
itself.

(2.) We must allow God to be omnipresent, or else we
must suppose him so confined and limited to a certain place,
as to be excluded from any othe1·; and if he can act in all
plaCOS, he must either be present in them, or his power
must be larger than his being, which is infinite; but after
this, we have not a power to conceive how a Being should
be present in the whole world, and not to be extended3 and
if it be extended, how it should be uncapable of being di-
vided into parts, which is certainly repugnant to the divine
nature. I therefore produce these two instances, to let the
Anti-Trinitarians see, that what they object in point of rea-
son, as to the incomprehensibility of the mystery of the
Trinity, will in consequence overthrow the divine nature.
But as there is the highest reason to believe there is a God,
though we cannot comprehend his perfectioris, so there may
be great reason to believe the doctrine of the Trinity,
though we cannot comprehend the manner of it.

P. I had thought you intended to explain the mystery
of it, and now you tell us it is incomprehensible.

Pr. It is a good step to our believing it, to make it
plain, that the difficulty of our conception ought not to
