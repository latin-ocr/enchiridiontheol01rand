TO HIS CLERGY. 339

self best; and then to understand others. Let him spare
himself least; but severely judge, censure, and condemn
himself. If he be learned, let him shew it by wise teach-
ing, and humble manners. If he be not learned, let him
be sure to get so much knowledge as to know that, and so
much humility, as not to grow insolent, and puff'ed up by
his emptiness. For many will pardon a good man that is
less learned; but if he be proud, no man will forgive him.

XI. Let every minister be careful to live a life as ab-
stracted from the affairs of the world as his necessity will
permit him3 but at no hand to be immerged and princi-

be avoided, and what is of good report, and what he is
obliged to by any personal or collateral duty, that he may
do, but no more: ever remembering the saying of our
blessed Lord‚ In the world gese shall have trouble, but in me.

things refer yourself to God; but if you meet with evil

ple well, and prosperously, unless himself hath learned
humbly and cheerfully to obey his superior. For every
minister should be like the good centurion in the gospel;
himself is under authority, and he hath people under him.

XIV. Be sure in all your words and actions to preserve
Christian simplicity and ingenuity3 to do to others as you
would be done unto yourself; and never to speak what you
do not think. Trust to truth, rather than to your memory;
for this may fail you, that will never.

XV. Pray much and very fervently for all your pa—
rishioners, and all men that belong to you, and all that
belong to God; but especially for the conversion of souls;
and be very zealous for nothing, but for God's glory, and
