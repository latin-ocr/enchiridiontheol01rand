432 DOCTRINE OF THE TRINITY-AND

easily be cleared. For θέεν-νήτῃ, incomprehensibilz'ty, omni-
potency, belonging to the divine nature, as such, we ought
to say, Tlcat they are not three Eternals, three Incompre-
hemibles, three Almiglctie33 but one Eternal, one Incompre-
hensible, one Almighty. Because the attributes belonging
to the Persons, by reason of the divine nature, and the attri-
butes being really the same with it, the nature is the proper
subject of them, which being but one, we are not to distin-
guish them as to essential attributes, but only as to personal
relations and properties.

P. But if the three Persons be coeternal, how is it possi-
ble to conceive there should not be three eternals?

Pr. This seems the hardest expression in the whole
Creed; but it is to be interpreted by the scope and design
of it, which is, that the essential attributes are not to be dis-
tinguished, though the Persons be. And so eternity is not
taken as a personal attribute, but as essential; and so they

are not three Eternals‚ but one Eternal. And the great de-
sign of the Creed was, to shew, that the Christian church did

not believe such a Trinity as consisted of three Persons, un-
equal and different in nature, and substance, and duration.

P. But what say you to the damning all those who do
not believe it, in the beginning and end of it?

Pr. This is off from our business. But to let you see I
will not avoid the difficulties you offer, I will give you an
answer even to this. The meaning is not, that every one is
damned who doth not conceive aright of the difference of
nature and person in the Trinity, or of the essential and
persona] attributes3 but that those who set up in opposition
to it the worship of a mere creature as God, or the worship
of more gods than one, or who wilfully reject this article of
the Christian saith, when it is duly proposed to them, are
guilty of a damning sin. For even the disbelief of Christi-
anity itself is not supposed to be the cause of men's damna-
tion‚ 'but where the doctrine of the gospel hath been pro-
posed in a way of credibility. If, when this doctrine of the
Trinity is proposed to men's minds, they will not consider
it, nor weigh the arguments on both sides impartially‚ but
