TRANSUBSTANTIATION. 77

and in a sacramenta} signification his bodyc, wheras elles,
the verie bread which he tooke, brake, and gaue them,
could not be in any wise his naturall bodye, for that were
confusyon of substances. And therfore the verye wordes
of Christ ioyned with the nexte sentence following, both
enforceth vs to confesse the verye bread to remayn still,
and also openeth vnto vs howe that bread maye be, and
is thus by his diuine power, hys bodye which was giuen
for vs. But here I remembre I haue redde in soome
writers of the contrarie opinion, whiche doo denye, that that
whiche Christ dyd take, he brake. For (saie they) after
his taking he blessed it, as Marcke doth speke, and by his Μῆτις xiv.

and latelye renued nowe in our daies with an eloquent stile
and muche finesse of witte. But what can crafty inuention,
subtiltie in sophismes, eloquence, or finesse of witte preuailc
against the infallible worde of God?

What nede we to striue, and contend, what thing wc
breake, for Paule saith speking vndoubtedlie of the Lordes
table, the breade (saieth he) whiche wee breake, is it not
the partakinge or felowshyp of the Lol'des bodie? W here-
upon it foloweth that after the thankesgeuing, it is broad
whiche we breake. And how often in the Acts of the
Apostles is the Lords supper signified by breakingc of
breade? They did perseuer (saleth St. Luke) in the Apo-Acts ii-
