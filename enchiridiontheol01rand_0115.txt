TRANSUBSTANTIATION. 101

Yt is not this bodie which ye doo see, that ye shal eatc,
neither shall ye drincke this bloud, which the Soudiares
that crucefye me schall spille, or shedde: I doe commende
vnto you a misterie or a sacramente, whiche spiritually vn-
derstanded shall geue you life. Nowe if Christ hadde no
moe naturall and corporall bodies but that one, whiche they
then presentlie boeth harde, and saw; and none other na-
turall bloude, but that whiche was in the same bodie, and
the whiche the souldiers cruellye did after shedde vppon
the Crosse, and neither this bodie, nor this bloude, was by
this declaration of S. Augustine, either to be eaten, or
dronken, but the misterie therof spirituallye to be vnder—
standed: Then I conclude, (if this saiyng and exposition
of S. Augustine be trew) that the misterie whiche the dis-
ciples shoulde eate, was not the naturall bodie of Christe,
but a misteri of the same, spirituallye to be vnderstanded.
For as S. Augustine saieth in his Qoth booke contra F au-
stum, Cap. 21, Christes fleashe and bloude was in theOlde
Testament promised by similitudes, and signes of their sae
crefyces, and was exhibited in deede, and in trueth, vpon
the crosse, but the same is celebrated by a sacrament of re-
membrance vpon the aulter.

And in his booke de fide ad Petrum, Cap. 19, he saeth
that in these Sacrifices (meaninge of the olde lawe) it is
figuratiuelie signified, what then was to be geuen: But in
this Sacrifice it is euidentlie signified what is alreadie geuen,
vnderstanding in the sacrifice vpon the aulter, the remem-
braunce and thankes geuing for the fleashe, whiche he of-
fered for vs, and for the bloude whyche he shedde for vs
vppon the Crosse, as is in the same place, and euidentlye
there it maie appeare.

Another euidente and cleare place, wherein it appeareth
that by the Sacramentall breade, whyche Christe called hys
bodye‚ he meante a fygure of hys bodie, is vppon the thyrde
Psalme: Where Sancte Augustine speaketh thus in plainc
tearmes. Christe did admit Judas vnto the feast, in the
whiche he commended to his disciples the fygurc of hys
bodye. Thys was Christos laste supper before hys Passionffi
