ΟΝ ΤΗΕ TRINITY. 457

nature of God furnishes us with other arguments of the
truth and certainty of it. And,

lst, It is not consistent with the justice, wisdom, or good-
ness of God, to require us to believe that, which, according
to the frame and make he has given us, it is impossible for
us to believe: for however some men have advanced this
paradox, that God can make contradictions true, Ι am very
certain, that, upon an impartial trial of their faculties, they
would find it were perfectly out of their power to believe
explicidy, and in the common sense of the terms, that a part
can be bigger than the whole it is a part of. But,

2dly, Admitting it possible for us to be deceived in such
propositions which have a constant, uniform, and universal
appearance of truth and evidence, this would destroy all
manner of certainty and knowledge, and leave us wholly
in darkness, ignorance, and despair; or, which is more in-
jurious to the divine goodness to imagine, under an abso-
lute necessity of being deceived: for it is not only impossi-
ble for me to believe, that such a proposition as this, That
the whole is bigger than any of its parts, is false; but I
cannot deny my positive express assent to it as true: the
light and evidence in this case is so clear and strong, that I
am not at liberty so much as to suspend my judgment.

3dly, It is blasphemy to think, that God can contradict
himself; and therefore right reason being the voice of God,
as well as revelation, they can never be directly contrary to
one another.

Now to apply all this to the present case; suppose I am
required to believe, That one and the same God is three
different Persons: I only suppose it here, because I have
not yet proved how far, and in what sense, we are obliged
to believe a Trinity. If this, I say, be the proposition I am
required to give my assent to, it is plain, by what has been
proved before, that I can believe it no farther than the
termS, of which it is made up, are known and understood,
and the ideas signified by them consistent.

In order therefore to form a determinate act of faith in
this point, I must carefully examine myself what notions 1
