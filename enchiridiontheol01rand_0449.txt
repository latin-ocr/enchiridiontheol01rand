TRANSUBSTANTIATION COMPARED. 435

why should you not do as much now as to transubstanti-
ation ?

Pr. In plain truth, because I cann0t; for here lies a vast
difference between them. In the Trinity we considered an
infinite Being, to which no bounds can be set without de-
stroying its nature3 but in transubstantiation we suppose a
true finite body, which hath its natural bounds and limits
to one certain place, and yet you will and must suppose this
body to be equally present in many thousand distant places
at the same time; which implies so great a repugnancy to
the very nature of a body, that I can by no means give my

assent to 1t.
P. Alas! Is this it which chokes your reason, so that

you cannot swallow the doctrine of the church in this
matter ?

You do not consider, that though we allow nothing infi-
nite in the body itself; yet we suppose an infinite power to
be employed about it; and an infinite power may produce
things above our comprehensions‚ about bodies in them-
selves finite.

Pr. This is the utmost your cause will bear; but Ι pray
tell me, is there any such thing as a repugnancy in the na-
ture of things, or not? i. e. Are there not some things
which are endued with such properties, that if you alter
them, you destroy their very nature3 as, to suppose an in-
divisible line, a triangle without lines, a body without di-
mensions?

P. Hold a little3 a body must have dimensions belonging
to it, but it is not necessary it should have those dimen-
sions wherever it is present. For it may be present in one
place as a body, and in another after the manner of a spirit.

Pr. You' might as well have said, a body may be consi-
dered two ways; as it is a body, and as it is not a body;
for there can be no body where there are no dimensions
proper to it.

P. See how you are mistaken3 for ‘⁶ it is not the dimen-
“ sions which seem to hinder a body being in more places at
“ once, but its unity 3⁹⁹ as Bellarmin well observes.
