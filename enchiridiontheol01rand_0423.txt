TRANSUBSTANTIATION COMPARED. 409

doubt there, but the infallible authority of the church3 and
whether that be more clear in the scripture than the doc-
trine of the Trinity.

P. I see you have a mind to change your discourse, and
to run off from the Trinity to the church authority in mat-
ters of saith, which is a beaten subject.

Pr. Your church doth not tell you so, and therefore
you may upon your own grounds be deceived; and Ι as-
sure you that you are so; for Ι intended only to shew you,
that for points of saith we must examine and compare scrip-
ture ourselves, and our faith must rest on divine revelation
therein contained.

P. Then you think the Trinity can bc proved from
scripture ?

Pr. Or else I should never believe it.

P. But those places of scripture you go upon may bear
a figurative sense, as John x. 30. Ι and my F ather are one,-
and 1 John v. 7. And those three are 0ne; and if they do
so, you can never prove the Trinity from them.

Pr. I say therefore, that the doctrine of the Trinity doth
not depend merely on these places, but on very many others,
which help to the true sense of these3 but transubstanti-
ation depends upon one single expression, This ‘ZS my body,
which relates to a figurative thing, viz. the sacrament, and
which bath other expressions joined with it, which are owned
to be figurative ς Ticis cup is the new testament ’ἐπ my
blood ,· and which in the literal sense cannot prove transub-
stantiation, as your own writers confess, and which is dis-
proved by those places of scripture, which assert the broad
and the fruit of the vine to remain after consecration.

P. Shew the literal sense as to the Trinity to be neces-
sary; for I perceive you would fain go off again.

Pr. Will you promise to hold close to *the argument
yourself ?

Ρ. You need not fear me.

Pr. I pray tell me, were there not false religions in the
world when Christ came into it to plant the true religion?

P. Yes; but‘how far is this from the business?
