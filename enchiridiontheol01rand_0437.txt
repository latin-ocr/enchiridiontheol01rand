TRANSUBSTANTIATION COMPARED. 423

believe the instrument uncreated‚ then you must assert him
to be true God by nature3 and then we have all we desire.
P. But the Socinians do not like this answer of the
Arians, and therefore they interpret these places of the
state of things under the gospel, and not of the creation of

th w rld.
ePri) They have not one jot mended the matter; for,

(1.) Where the new creation is spoken of, some circum-
stances are added which limit the sense to it; as when St.
Paul saith, We are created in Christ Jesus unto good morke,
that we should walle z'n them, Eph. ii. 10. Who could pos-
sibly understand this of the old creation? And so, [f'angy
man be in Christ Jews, he is a new creature, 2 Cor. v. 17.
But in the other places, the same expressions are used,
which are attributed to the whole creation, without limita-
tion from circumstances, or from the context and occasion
of them.

(2.) There are some things said to be created by Christ
J esus, which cannot relate to the new creation; for by him
were all things created, that are z‘n heaven, and that are in
earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or do-
minions, or principalities, or powers, Col. i. 16. How are
these created by preaching the gospel‚ when they are un-
capable of the proper means of it; which are, the doctrine
of the remission of sins upon repentance, and the renewing
and sanctifying grace of God?

P. But St. Paul doth not mention the heaven and earth,
but only intellectual beingS‚ angels and men, and therefore
he speaks of the new creation.

Pr. A mighty argument indeed Ξ Do not all things com-
prehend the heaven and earth? And the particular enu-
meration of angels by several denominations, shews that he
speaks of another creation distinct from that by the gospel
preached to the world3 for the apostles were Christ's in-
struments in this new creation, which they could not be to
the invisible powers above.

P. We have now gone through the true and only grounds
of the doctrine of the Trinity.
