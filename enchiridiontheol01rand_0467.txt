ΟΝ ΤΗΕ TRINITY. 453

that the whole. substance, nature, and essence of the soul is
wholly and entirely in all the body considered together, and
wholly and entirely in every single particle of it. And this
is a notion which at first view has a great appearance of
truth and clearness, and is such as the understanding rea-
dily closes with 2 but if we would strictly and distinctly ex-
amine ourselves what we mean by those terms, I believe
we should be able to give but a very obscure account of our
opinion; and at last be forced to confess we understand no

speak justly and intelligibly: and not being yet prepossessed
in favour of any particular explication‚ the better to preserve
my freedom of examining the subject in hand, I have pur-
