TRANSUBSTANTIATION COMPARED. 427

Pr. It may be others have not had the leisure or curi-
osity to examine a mystery believed to be so much out of
the reach of our understanding3 or have confounded them-
selves and others so much with school-terms‚ as to leave
the matter rather more obscure than it was before. But
Ι shall endeavour to make things as clear as they will bear.
And that which I insist upon is, that the absurdities are
not to appearance so great as those of transubstantiation.
And therefore Ι desire you to produce those which appear
the most dreadful.

P. I shall reduce all to these two, which comprehend
the rest.

1. How there can be three Persons and but one God.

2. How these can agree in a third, and not agree among
themselves.

For the first, it seems very absurd, that there should be
three Persons really distinct, whereof every one is G0d‚
and yet there should not be three Gods; for nothing is more
contradictious than to make three not to be three, or three
to be but one.

Pr. Ι hope now you will give me leave to make an an-
swer to your difficulty as distinct as possible. We do not
say that three persons are but one person, or that one na-
ture is three natures; but that there are three persons in
one nature. If therefore one individual nature be com-
municable to three persons, there is no appearance of ab-
surdity in this doctrine. And on the other side, it will be
impossible there should be three Gods, where there is one
and the same individual nature3 for three Gods must have
three several divine natures‚ since it is the divine essence
which makes a God. But to make this more plain, do you

make any difference between nature and person ,9
Ρ. Yes.

Pr. Wherein lies it?

P. Excuse me, sir, for you have undertaken to explain
these thIngs.

Pr. I will begin with person. Which name was origi-
nally taken among the Romans from some remarkable dis-
