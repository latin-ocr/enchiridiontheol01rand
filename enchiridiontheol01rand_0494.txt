480 BISHOP GASTRELL

to use a common instance, when it is said, that God looks
down and beholds what is done among the children of mem
that he hears the cries of the righteous, and the blasphemies
of the wicked‚ it is not to be imagined that he sees as man
sees, that he makes use of any organs of sense3 but it is thus
expressed to give us more lively notions and impressions of
the certainty of God’s universal knowledge; to assure us
that God more plainly, fully, and infallibly knows whatever
is done in all the earth, than we are capable of knowing
those things which fall within the reach of our senses.

This being premised, it seems very plain to me that the
doctrine of the Trinity is not to be looked upon as a nice ab-
stracted speculation designes] for the exercise of our under-

relations, by which God has been pleased to express that
eternal distinction in the Godhead to us, should be chiefly

salvation. ’

Thus far then the scriptures require us to believe3 that
the one only supreme God, upon his foreknowledge of man's
fall, did from al] eternity purpose and decree to redeem man-
kind into a capacity of salvation, by the death and constant
mediation of a man chosen and enabled for this work by the
fielnes-9 of God dwellz'ng in him: and in consideration of his
passion and intercession, to impart such gifts, graces, and
spiritual assistances, as would be sufficient to render this re-
demption effectual to the saving of 'much people. i

And moreover we are tobelieve, that God has accord-
ingly executed this his gracious design towards us, by send-
ing into the world Christ Jesus, the man whom before he
had ordained‚ that he should in the fulness of time be born,
and suffer for our sins; in and by whom, as has already
