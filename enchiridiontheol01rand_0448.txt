434 DOCTRINE OF THE TRINITY AND

P. But you can bring no other instance but the thing in
question, and therefore this is a petitio principii, or taking
that for granted which is in dispute.

Pr. I do not think it to be so, where the reason is assign-
ed from the peculial· properties of the divine nature, to
which there can be no parallel. And I think it very un-
reasonable in the Socinians, to send us to created beings for
the rules and measures of our judgment concerning a Be-
ing acknowledged to be infinite.

P. Are not the divine Persons infinite, as well as the di-
vine nature? and therefore as created persons do take in the
whole nature, so infinite persons will do the infinite nature.

Pr. No question, but the persons are infinite in regard of
the nature which is s03 but if an infinite nature be commu-
nic-able to more persons than one, every such person cannot
appropriate the whole nature to itself.

P. If the difference be on the account of infinity, then
there must be an infinite number of persons in the divine
essence.

Pr. I answer, That infiniteness of number is no perfec-
ti0n; and as to the number of persons, we follow not our
own conjectures, nor the authority of the church; but di-
vine revelation, which hath assured us, that there is but one
God, and yet chere are three that are one; which depends
not merely on the place of St. John, but the form of bap-
tism is remarkable to this purpose, which joins together the
Father, tlte Son, and the Holqj Ghost, without any other
distinction besides that of order and relation. And it is
against the fundamental design of Christianity to join any
created beings together with God in so solemn an act of re-
ligion. And St. Paul joins them together in his benedic-
tion; The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love (ff

. God, and the' communion of tlte Holgy Ghost, be with you all.

Amen. 2Cor. xiii. 14. From whence the Christian church
hath always believed a Trinity of Persons in the unity of
the divine nature.

P. You have taken a great deal of pains to clear the doc-
trine of the Trinity from any absurdity in point of reason,
