TRANSUBSTANTIATION. ’71

the holie sacrament ordeined by Christ himself, a thing no
better than a piece of commen baken bread, or that do saie,
that suche do make the holie sacramente of the blessed
bodie and bloude of Christ, nothing els but a bare signe or
figure to represente Christ, none otherwise then the Iuie
bushe doeth represente the wine in a taverne, or as a vile
person gorgiouslie appareled maie represente a kinge, or a
prince, in a plaic? Alas let vs leaue liyng, and speake the
truth euerie man not onely to his neighbour, but also of his
neighbour, for we are membres one of another saith St.
Paule. The controuersie no doubte whiche at thys daye Eph. v.
troubleth the churche (wherin anye meane learned man ei-
ther olde or newe doth stand in) is not whether the holie
sacrament of the bodye and bloud of Christ is no better
then a piece of commen breade or not? Or whether the
Lordes table is no more to bee regarded then the table of
any earthlye man or noe? Or whether it is but a bare signe
or figure of Christ and nothing elles or noe? For all do
graunt that St. Paules wordes do require, that the breade
which we breake, is the partaking of the bodie of Christ.
And all also doe graunt him that eateth of that breade or
drinketh of that cuppe vnworthilie, to bee giltie of the
Lordes death, and to eate and drinke his owne damnation,
because he estemeth not the Lordes bodie. All do graunt
that these wordes of St. Paule when he saith (if we eate it, 1 Cor. viii.
avantageth vs nothing, 01· if wee cate not, we want nothing
therby) are not spoken of the Lordes table, but of other
commen meates.

Thus then hitherto yet we all agree. But nowe lette vs
see wherin the dissention doeth stande. The vnderstanding
of that wherin it doth chieflie stand is a steppe to the true
searching furth of the trueth. For who can seekc well a re-

medie, if he know not before the disease?

It is neither to be denied nor dissembled, that in the
· matter of this sacramente there bee diuerse pointes, where-
in men counted to be learned carme not agree. As whe-
ther there be any transubstantiation of the breade or no?

Any corporall and carnal presence of Christes substance or
