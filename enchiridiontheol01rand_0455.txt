TRANSUBSTANTIATION COMPARED. 441

Pr. But let us in the first place agree what we mean by
lt.

P. By the incarnation, I mean, the union of the divine
and human nature, so as to make one person in Christ.

Pr. If this be not possible, it must either be, 1¹. Because
two natures different from each other cannot be united to
make one person; the contrary whereof appears in the union
of soul and body to the person of a man. Or, 2. Because
it is impossible that an infinite nature should be united to a
finite.

P. How can there be an union possible between two
beings infinitely distant from each other?

Pr. Not in that respect wherein the distance is infinite;
but if there be nothing destructive to either nature in such
an union, and the infinite nature do condescend to it, why
may it not be so united to an intelligent finite being, as to
make one person together with it? For in respect of union,
the distance is not so great between finite and infinite, as
between body and spirit.

P. The distance is infinite in one case, but not' in the
other.

Pr. I do not speak of them with respect to perfectioris,
but to un'10n; and an infinite distance in that must imply
an absolute repugnancy, which you can never prove: for,
since body and spirit may be united to make one person, an
infinite Spirit may be united to a finite nature.

P. But the manner of the hypostatical union is impos-
sible to be conceived.

Pr. Let the thing be granted possible, and the difficulty
of conceiving the manner may be as great in the union of
soul and body. Will you undertake to explain that to me?
and yet I hope you believe it. But let us hear your diffi-
culties again, which you object from Bellarmin.

P. ‘⁶ That there should be but one hypostasis in two na-
“ tures; and that in the union the natures should not be
‘⁶ confounded, nor the hypostasis divided.''

Pr. All these difficulties arise from the sense of the
word hypostasis: which originally signifies a real being.
