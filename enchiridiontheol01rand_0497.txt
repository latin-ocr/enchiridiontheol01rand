capable of believing, concerning the doctrine of the Trinity,
viZ. That these three different terms, Father, Son, and
Holy Glaost, are all applied in scripture to the one only su-
preme God3 that all the actions, offices, and relations, which
are in scripture ascribed to any of these names, (excepting
those proper to the human nature of Christ,) are there
plainly attributed, and do truly belong to one and the same
divine nature3 that there are such frequent and evident
assertions of the unity of God in scripture, and yet such
plain expressions of distinction, signified by these terms,
Fatlwr, Son, and Holgy Glzost, as imply a consistency of
unity and distinction in the Godhead3 that this distinction,
whatever it be, is not the same with that we conceive be-
twixt the attributes of God, which are partial conceptions
of his essence, not a mere difference of name, office, or rela-
tion, such as is signified by the like terms, when applied to
men, (though these are all the differences we can expressly
conceive, as applicable to the divine nature,) but some other
distinction, which we have but a confused perception of,
and cannot comprehend or explain by any particular ideas;
which unknown inexplicable distinction is the foundation of
,all these differences expressly conceived by us,

And since the church has thought fit, for the sake of
unity and peace, and for the suppressing of private disputes
and interpretations, to appoint set forms to express this our
faith in, I think the Athanasian Creed as rational an expli-
cation of the Trinity as can well be made. The worst that
the enemies of this doctrine can say of it is, that it is an un-
necessary multiplication of terms, and too nice an endeavour
to explain what cannot be explained, but not that it is false,
or absurd3 nothing being there asserted in any sense incon-
sistent with the unity of God, or the principles of right rea-
son: all such meanings and significations of any terms or
expressions in that Creed being very improper, as they are
there applied, and utterly disclaimed by the church that en-
joins the use of it.

Nor can it be esteemed an unreasonable imposition, that

we should be obliged to profess our faith of something
