vni ’ PREFACE.

not much controverted. Of bishop Gibson's “ Pas-
“ toral Letters'’ the latter part of the fourth and the
whole fifth are omitted; of which the former is le-
velled against the particular practices of the Me—
thodists of tha't time, the latter against the particular
danger then to be dreaded from Popery.

The sermons of bishop Conybeare in the second
volume are amongst the single sermons published in
his lifetime, and are not contained in the two volumes
printed by subscription after his death.

It may require some apology perhaps that I have
added a work so purely controversial, and full of
personal satire, as “ Dr. Bentley’s Remarks on Free—
“ Thinking :⁹⁹ but the many just observations it con-
tains, the ready and clear solution which it gives of
several difficulties of great moment, (as for instance,
of that concerning the various readings of the New
Testament3) and the spirit of sound criticism and
true learning which goes through the whole, seem

to me fully to entitle it to the place here assigned
to 1t.
