ΟΝ SCRIPTURE MYSTERIES. 397

(5.) It is more reasonable to believe that Christ Jesus
should suffer as he did for our sakes than for his own. We
are all agreed that the sufferings of Christ were far beyond
any thing he deserved at God's hands3 but what account
then is to be given of them? We say that he made him-
self the voluntary sacrifice for expiation of the sins of man-
kind; and so there was a great and noble end designed, and
no injury done to a willing mind; and the scripture as
plainly expresses this, as it can do in words. But others
deny this, and make him to suffer as one wholly innocent3
for what cause? To make the most innocent persons as ap-
prehensive of suffering as the most guilt.y; and the most
righteous God to put no difference between them, with re-
spect to suffering?

(6.) It is more reasonable to suppose such a condescen-
sion in the Son of God to take upon him the form of a ser-
vant for our advantage, than that a mere man should be
exalted to the honour and worship which belongs only to
God. For, on the one side, there is nothing but what is
agreeable to the divine nature, viz. infinite love and con-
descension and piety to mankind ; on the other, there is the
greatest design of sels-exaltation that ever was in human
nature, viz. for a mere man to have the most essential attri-

And whether of these two is more agreeable to the spirit
and design of the New Testament‚ let any man of under-
standing judge. For as it is evident‚ that the great inten-
tion of it is to inagnify the wonderful love of God in the
sending of his Son; so it is as plain, that one great end of
the Christian doctrine was to take mankind off from giving
divine worship to creatures3 and can we then suppose that
at the same time it should set up the worship of a mere inan
with all the honour and adoration which belongs to God?
This is to me an incomprehensible mystery indeed, and far
beyond all that is implied in the mysteries of the Trinity
and Incarnation. For it subverts the very foundation of
the design of Christianity as to the reforming idolatry then
in being-3 it lays the foundation for introducing it into the
