from any imaginable point of space: it is the limited powers
and faculties of created beings which are the foundation of
all local distinctions : and therefore, when we endeavour to
represent God to our thoughts in this manner, we consider
him as omnipresent; and I can no more conceive three Om-
nipresents, than I can conceive three straight lines drawn
between the same points.

But though there can be but one undivided Omnipresence,
may there not be three infinite Beings coequal to one ¹an-
other, and commensurate to one infinite space? This is far
above my conception too: ‘infinite swallows up all my
thoughts. Whatever idea we apply this term infinite to, I
think it impossible to apply it to another of the same deno-
mination: as for example3 if I apply it to power, I cannot
consider it as applicable to more than one infinite Power:
for infinite Power includes all the possibilities of action; so
that to conceive more than one infinite Power, would be to
conceive more power than is possible3 which is a gross and
palpable absurdity. And therefore we cannot conceive three
infinite Beings distinct from one another, any more than
three infinite powers, or three infinite spaces, because all dis-
tinction implies some limitation, and limitation is a contra-
diction to infinity. We can indeed conceive infinite power,
as in some manner bounded by infinite wisdom, justice,
mercy, or the like3 but in no wise as limited by any other
power. We cannot therefore conceive one infinite Being as
bounded by another infinite Being; for then we should con-
ceive one infinite power limited by another power, and the
like of all other attributes, which are the same in both: for
the notion of an infinite Being includes in it all the imagin-
able kinds of infinite perfection.

But if we say, there are three infinite Beings, and all the
perfectioris of each are coincident, what ground can we have
for such a distinction? Not so much, to use the former in-
stance, as for that of three straight lines between the same
points3 for there the different times of describing the same
line may in some manner help us to form a confused con-
ception of different lines: but it is not in the power of the
