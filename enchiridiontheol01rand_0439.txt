What think you now of the proofs of the Trinity-in
scripture? Do you think Bellarmin could produce any
thing like this for transubstantiation? No, so far from it,
that where he sets himself in a whole chapter to prove it Bell. de
from scripture, he produces a first without a second( “ The ἓυιοξ· ¹· iii.
“ first argument,” saith he, “is taken from Christ⁹s words,
“ This is mys body?7 Very well ! but where is the second?
For no more could be produced but this one single passage,
about which he spends his whole chapter, and then betakes
himself presently to the fathers.

P. But one plain and clear place is sufficient, if we be
certain of the sense of that one3 for we are as much bound
to believe God when we are sure he speaks it once, as an
hundred times.
