438 DOCTRINE OF THE TRINITY AND

Pr. Then it is impossible there should be any distance;
without which it is impossible there should be the order of
parts in a human body. Thus, there is a repugnancy in
the very supposition of Christ's body being in the wafer,
though there were but one single wafer; but when to this
we add, that it is equally thus present in thousands of
wafers at. what distance of place soever‚ the absurdities do
increase and multiply so fast upon us, that it is hardly pos-
sible to imagine any thing concerning a body, which doth
imply more than this doth. As that one and the same body
should be indivisibly present in many places, where it must
be divided from itself‚ by so many bodies interposing3 so
that it is impossible to apprehend how two bodies can be
divided from one another more effectually, than such a
body must be from itself‚ if it be present in many places
at once.

P. I pray stop here; for reckon up as many absurdities
as you will, they are all but the effects of carnal reason,
and we must captivate our zcnderstanding to the obedience
offaitk.

Pr. Then it is to no purpose to argue any farther on the
point of reason; and I thought you designed this for one
part of your parallel.

P. So Ι did; and 1 still say, there are things as hard to
make out about the Trinity‚ which you have not yet taken
notice of.

Pr. I pray let us hear them, that we may put an end to
this discourse.

P. What say you then to one and the same nature being
in three distinct persons, which, Bellarmin saith, “is more
“ wonderful than that one body should be in many places3
“ because the nature is identified with the persons, but the
‘⁶ body is not so with the places in which it is present.'' If
therefore the same nature be not divided from itself in the
Persons of the Trinsty, how much more easily may one
body be present in several places, and not be divided from
itself?

Pr. It is strange neither Bellarmin nor you should dis.
