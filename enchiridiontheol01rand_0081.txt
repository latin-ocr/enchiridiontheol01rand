TRANSUBSTANTIATION. 67

so here briefelye to sette forth the saiyngs of thy sonne our
Sauiour Christ, of his euangelists, and of his apossses, that
in this aforesayd controuersie the light of thy trueth‚ by the
lanterne of thy worde maie shine unto all them that loue
thee.
Of the Lordes last supper do speake especially three of
the Euangelists, Matthewe‚Ma1ke‚ and Luke. But none1 Mat xv
m01e plainlie, nor more fully declarethe the same, then Yalk
doeth S. Paul, partelie 111 1116 10111, but especiallye m the 1Cor x. xi.
11111 Chapiter of the firste Epistle unto the Corinthianes.
As Mathewe and Marke doe agree muche in forme of
woordes‚ So doeth likewise Luke and S. Paule. But all
foure no doubte, as they were all taught 111 0116 5611016, and
enspired with one spirite, so taughte they all one trueth.

God graunte 115 to vnderstande it well.
