414 DOCTRINE OF THE TRINITY AND

sible, that a creature might be in the nearer capacity of be-
ing made God. But those who consider and know what
God is, and what he must be, if he be God, will find far
greater difficulty in making man to be God, than in believ-
ing God to be made man. For this implies no greater diffi-
culty, than merely as to our conception how an infinite Be-
ing can be so united to a finite, as to become one person;
which implies no repugnancy‚ but only some thing above
our capacity to comprehend. And we confess ourselves
puzzled in the manner of conceiving how a finite spirit,
which can pass through a body, can be so united to it as to
make a man by that union; yet we all acknowledge the
truth of this. But to suppose a creature capable of being
made God, is to overthrow the essential difference between
God and his creatures, and the infinite distance between
them. Which is of very pernicious consequence, as to the
great ends of the Christian religion, which were to reform
the world, and to restore the distinction between God and
his creatures3 which by the prevalency of idolatry was al-
most lost in the world: the supreme God being hardly dis-
cerned in such a crowd of created and factitious gods And
this very argument is enough to turn my stomach against
Socinianism or Arianism.

P. I had thought all men of sense among you had been
Socinians; I have often heard them charged with being so.

Pr. You see how grossly you are deceived, notwithstand-
ing your pretence to infallibility. Ι do not pretend to any
deep reach, but Ι see reason enough to be no Socinian.

P. Let us return to our matter in hand. What say you
to those texts which are said to be inconsistent with the

literal sense of those before mentioned, which relate to the
unity between Father and Son?

Pr. What texts do you mean?

P. What say you to John x. from the 30th to the 39th?
Pr. Ι wonder what it is produced for.

P. 1. It is said, John x. 30. Ι and my F ather are one,-

now it is highly unreasonable to interpret these words lite-
rally, because of those which follow.
