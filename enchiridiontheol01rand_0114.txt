100 RIDLEY AGAINST

wolde not take hede what he dyd saye, and specialy what
he wold write in so high a matter, so that he might haue
the better hand off his aduersarie: Ys this credible to be
trewe in any godly wyseman? Howe much lesse then is it
worthy to be thowght, or credited in a man off so great wyt,
lernyng, and excellency, as Tertullian is worthely esteamed
euer to haue bene?

Lykwise this author in his first booke against the same
heretike Martion writeth thus. God dyd not reiect bread,
which is his creature3 for by it he hath made a representa-
tion off his bodye. Nowe I prai you what is this to say,
that Christ hath made a representation by breade of his
bodye, but that Christ hath instituted and ordeined bred to
be a sacrament, for to represent vnto vs his bodye. Nowe
whether the representation of one thinge by another, rc-
quireth the corporall presence of the thinge which is so re-
presented, or no, euery man that hath vnderstanding, is ha-
ble in this pointe (the matter is so cleare of itselfe,) to be a
sufficient iudge.

The second doctor and wryter off the Latine churche
whose saiynges Ι promised to set furth, is S. Augustine, off
whose lernyng, and estimation, Ι neede not to speake; for
all the churche of Christ both hath, and euer hath had hym
for a man of moost singular learning, witte and dilygence,
both in setting fourth the true doctrine of Christes religion,
and also in the defense off the same againste heretikes.

This awthor as he hath written most plenteously in other
matters off our saith, so likewise in this argument he hathe
written at large in manye off his workes so plainli against
this error of transubstantiation, that the Papists loue least
to heare of him off all other writers, partly for his authori-
tye, and partly because he openeth the matter more fully
then any one other doth. Therfore I will reherse moe
places off him, then heretofore 1 haue done of the other.

And firste what can be more playne, then that whiche he
writeth vppon the 89ὼ psalme speking of the sacramente of
the Lordcs bodyc and blond, and rehersing (as yt were)
Christos wordcs to his disciplcs afftcr this maner.
