TRANSUBSTANTIATION. 105

any thing can be more playnlye spoken, then theis wordes
be against the error of Transubstantiation3 which is the

grownd, and bitter roote whervppon springeth all the horri-
ble errours before rehersed.

Wherfore seing that the falsehood hereos doth appeare so
manyfestly, and by so many wayes, so plainely‚ so clearelie‚
and so fullye, that no man nedeth to be deceiued‚ but he
that will not see, or will not vnderstand‚ let vs all that doo
Ioue the truth, embrase yt, and forsake the falsehed, for he
that loueth the truth‚ is of God, and the lacke of the loue
theros, is the cause why God suffereth men to fall into er‘-
rours, and to perish thet-in, yea and as St. Paule saith, why
he sendeth vnto them illusyones, that they beleue lyes, vnto
their owne condemnatyon: Because (sayth he) they loued
not the truthe. This truth‚ no dowbt‚ is Goddes word, for
Christ himself sayth‚ vnto his Father: Thy word is truthe3
the Ioue, and light wherof, Almightye God our heauenlye
Father giue vs, and lighten it in owr heartes‚ by his holye
Spiryte, throwghe J esus Christ our Lorde‚ Amen.
