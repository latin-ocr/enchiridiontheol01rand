104 RIDLEY AGAINST

his grace, by his prouidence, and by his diuine nature, and
howe he is absent by his natural bodie, which was born of the
virgine Marie‚ dyed, and rose for vs, and is ascended into
heauen, and ther sitteth‚ as is in tharticles of our saith, on the
right hand of G0d‚ and theme, and from none other place
(saith S. Augustine) shall comme on the latter daye to iudge
the quicke and the dead. At the which daye the righteous
shall then lift vpp their heades, and the lighte of Godes
truth shall so shine‚ that falsehood, and errors shal be putte
to perpetual] confusion. Righteousnes shall haue the vpper
hand, and trewth that daie shall beare awaie the victorie,
all the Enemyes theros quyte ouerthrowen, to be troden vn-

O Lord, Lord, I beseach the, hast this daye3 then shalt

this cause.

Nowe therfore the last of all shal be Gelasius‚ which was
a Busshop of Rome, but one that was Busshopp of that
Sea, before the wicked vsurpation‚ and Tyrannye therof
spredde, and brast owt abroade into all the worlde‚ For
this man was before Bonffacius, yca and Gregory the first:
In whose daies, both corruption of doctrine, and tyrannicall
vsurpation did chiefly growe, and had the vpper hand.

Gelasius in an Epistle of the two natures of Christ, con-
tra Eutychen, writeth thus. The sacramentes of the bodie
and bloud of Christ, which we receue, are godly thinges‚
wherby, and by the same, we are made partakers of the di-
