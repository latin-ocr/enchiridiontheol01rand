THE CATHECHISME. 27

Scholer. Not onelye for hys owne holynesse: but for why the
that by hym are made holye the chosen of God‚ and mem- {fglfjfl'sm
bers of Christe. And thearfore haue the scriptures termedhosy-
him the spirit of sanctification or makyng holy.

Master. Wherin consysteth thys sanctification?

Scholer. Fyrste, we be newe gotten by his inward mo- Whearin
tion. And therfor, said Christ: we muste be newe borne 01²1?ngssss
water, and of the Spirit. Then by his inspiration are we sfmetificw
adopted, and as it wer bi choise made the chyldren of God.¹¹⁰¹¹·
For whych cause he is not causelesse called the spirit of
adoption. By his lyght are we lightened‚ to vnderstand
Gods misteryes. By hys iudgemcnt are sinnes pardoned

other meanes and policies: but the church whyche is an
assemble of men called to euerlastinge saluaeion, is bothc
gathered together, and gouerned by the Holy Ghost of
whom we euen now made mention. Which thyng, sith it
can not be perceiued bi bodily sense or light of nature, is
by right and for good reason, heare reckened amonge
thynges that are knowen by beleife. And thearfore thys Whythe
calling togither of the faithfull is called Vniuersall, because Ξᾞζῇιζῗ,
