THE CATHECHISME. ’ 25

euer is in vs, or maye be done of VS, pure, honest, true and
good, that altogether spryngeth out of thys most pleasaunte
roote, from this most plentyfull fountayne, the goodnesse,
loue, choyse and vnchaungeable purpose of God. He is the
cause, the rest are the fruites and effectes. Yet ar also the
goodnesse‚ choise and Spirit of God, and Christe himselfe,
causes conioyned and coupled eche wyth other: which mai
be reekened amonge the principall causes of our saluacion.
As ofte thearfore as we vse to saye, that wee are made Justiflca-
ryghteous and saued bi only faith: it is meante thearebyzgifflzhby
that fayth, or rather truste alone, doth lay hand vpon, vn- y ’
derstand and perceyue, our righteousmakyng to be geuen
vs- of God freely: that is to say, by no desertes of oure own, ,
but by the free grace of the Almighti Father. Moreouer
fayth doth engender in vs the loue of our neyghbour, and
sutch workes as God is pleased wythall. For if it be a
liuely and -true saith, quikned by the Holy Ghost, she is
the mother of all good sayinge and doynge. By thys short
tale is it euident, whence, and by what meanes we attayne
to be made righteous. For not by the worthynesse of our
deseruinges, were we eyther heartofore chosen, or long ago
saued: but by the only mercy of God, and pure grace of
Christ oure Lorde: whearby we weare in hym made to
those good workes, that God hath apointed for vs to walk
in. And althoughe good woorkes can not deserue to make Trew faithe
vs righteous before God: yet do thei so cleaue vnto faythe : ἳὲξθζὲἓὶἰ
that neither can fayth be founde without them, nor good
workes be any whear wythout faythe.
Master. Ι lyke very well thys shorte declaration of fayth
and workes: for Paul playnly teacheth the same. But
eanst thou yet further depaint me out that congregacion,
whych thou callest a kingdome or common weale of Chris-
tianes: and so set it out before mine eyes, that it may seue-

rally and playnly be knowen asonder from eche other fel-
lowshyppe of men?

Scholer. I will prouc howe well I can do it. Your plea-
sure is (maister) as I take it, that I point ye out some cer—
taine congregation, that may be seene.
