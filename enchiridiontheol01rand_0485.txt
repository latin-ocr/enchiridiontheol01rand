ΟΝ ΤΗΕ TRINITY. 47]

prejudiced reading of scripture, and considering the design,
connection, and analogy of those writings: and Ι am apt
to believe, if any man else took the same method, and con-
sidered things together, and not only in loose texts and pas-
sageS, the first result of his thoughts would be the same;
viz. That these terms, Famem Son, and de Ghost, must
all be so understood, as to include the same God in their
signification; and that any other sense or explication of the
words would be attended with greater difficulties.

But this being a reflection which is founded upon the
agreement and coherence of all the parts of scripture, it
would be a very improper and ineffectual design ¹to go
about to confirm the truth of it from some particular pas-
sages. Omitting therefore all those texts, which are a great
many, where any of these termS, Father, Son, or Holgy
(ἶῘιοεί, appear to be directly affirmed of God, according to a

from God the Famem and from our Lord Jesus Christ:
and particularly that he closes his second Epistle to the
Corinthians with this larger and fuller blessing3 The grace
of the Lord Jesns Christ, and the love of God, (md tlze com-
munion of the Holy Ghost he with you all. From whencc
I infer, that all these terms, F ather, Son, and Holgy Gkost,
