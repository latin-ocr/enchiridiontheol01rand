ΟΝ ΤΗΕ TRINITY. 467

And what we are to believe in this case is the subject of
my next inquiry; which Ι am persuaded may very easily
and quickly be resolved: for if we are fully satisfied from
revelation, that these terms, one and three, may, and ought
to be affirmed of God, but not in any sense of the words we
are here in this present state capable of conceiving: and
moreover, if it be true, as I have already shewn it is, that
we can believe a thing no farther than we understand the
terms in which it is proposed to us, it is plain from hence
that all we can possibly believe in the matter of the Trinity
is, that One and the *same God ἐἰς Three in some way or
manner we are not able to comprehend. And if we are sure
we cannot comprehend what this distinction is whereby God
is three, in vain do we look out for terms to express some-
thing which we have no manner of conception of. What-
ever words we use, whether person, hypostasis, or any other
we can invent, or languages furnish us with, they all signify
the same thing; that is, some kind of distinction we do not
understand. And we may rack our thoughts, tire our ima-
ginations, and break all the fibres of our hrain, and yet
never be able to deliver ourselves clearer.

All therefore that we can know of the Trinity by reason,
can amount to no more than an obscure confused know-
ledge, which we are forced to express in general and ab-
stracted terms, because we are sure no other reach our
thoughts, though these are not sufficient to explain all we
⁴ mean by thern.

Nor is this to be wondered at, that we should have con-
fused notions of things which no particular ideas our minds
are furnished with can render clearer to us: for if we consi-
der the degrees and limits of our knowledge, and take a
strict survey of our whole stock of thoughts, we shall find
there are very few things that'we know fully and distinetly.
Most of our notions differ only as more or less confused,
more or less general. There is a certain scale of knowledge,
wherein every thing is so fitted and ‘proportioned to our fa-
culties, that we cannot descend below such a determinate

pitch in our conceptions or explications of any object pro-
posed to us. ’ .
