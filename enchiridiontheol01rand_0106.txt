92 RIDLEY AGAINST

this reason reiected, as Clemens Alexandrinus, Theodore-
tus, J ustinus, Ecclesiastica Historia Nieephori, and other
suche.

Another answere they had, saiying that Origene is noted
to haue erred in some pointes, and therefore saith is not to
be geuen in this matter to hym.

But this aunswear well weighed doth minister good mat-
ter to the cleare confutation of it selfe. For in deede wee
graunt that in some pointes Origene did erre, but those er-
roures are gathered oute, and nooted boeth of S. Hierom,
and Epiphanius, soe that his workes (those erroures ex-
cepted) are now so muche the more of authoritie, that suche
greate learned menne, toke paines to drawe oute of him,
’ what so euer they thoughte in him to bee written amisse.
But as concerning this matter of the lordes supper, neither
they, nor yet euer any other auneient authour did euer saie
that Origene did erre.

Nowe because these two aunsweres haue bene of late soc
confuted and confounded, that it is well perceiued, that they
will take noe place, therfore some whiche haue written sence
that tyme, haue forged two other answeres euen of the same
mould.

The former wherof is, that Origene in this place spake
not of the sacramentali breade or wyne of the· lordes table,
but of another misticall meate, of the whiche S. Augustin
maketh mencion to be geuen vnto them that were taughte
the saith, before they were baptised. But Origenes owne
wordes in two sentences before rehersed beinge put toge-
ther, proueth this aunswere vntrue: For he saieth that he
meneth of that figuratiue and misticall bodye, whiche pro-
fiteth them that doe receiue it worthyly, alluding so plainly
vnto S. Paules wordes spoken of the Lordes supper, that
it is a shame for any learned manne once to open his mouth
to the contrarie. And that breade whiche S. Augustino
speaketh of, he can not proue that any suche thinge was
vsed in Origenes time : Yea and though that could be
proucd, yet was there neuer breade in any tyme called a sae
eramentall bodie sauing the sacramentall breade of the
