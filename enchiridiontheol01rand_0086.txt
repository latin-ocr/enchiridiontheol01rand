no? Whether adoracion onely due vnto God, is to be done
to the sacramente or no? And whether Christes bodie bee
there offered in deede vnto the heauenlye father by the
prieste or noe? Or whether the euell man receiue the na-
turall bodie of Christe or noe?

Yet neuerthelesse as in a man diseased in diuers parteS‚
commenlie the originall cause of suche diuers diseases
whiche are spredde abrode in the bodie do come from some
one chiese membre, as from the stomacke 01· from the
heade3 euen so al those fiue aforesaide pointes do chiefely
hange vpon this one question, whiche is, what is the matter
of the sacramente, whether is it the naturall substance of
breade, or the natural] substance of Christes own bodie.

The treuth of this question truelye tried out and agreed
vpon, no doubte shall cease the controuersie in all the
reaste. Foris it bee Christes owne naturall bodie, borne
of the virgine, then assuredlie, seynge that all learned men
in Englande, (so farre as I knowe) both newe and olde,
graunt there to be but one substance, then Ι say, they must
nedes graunt Transubstantiation, that is a change of the
substance of breade into the substance of Christes bodie3
then also they must graunt the carnall and corpora] presence
of Christes bodie; then must the sacrament be adored with
the honour due vnto Christ himself, for the vnitie of the
two natures in one person3 then if the prieste do offre the
sacramente, he doeth offre in deede Christ himselfe3 and
finallye the murtherer‚ the adulterer, or wicked man, receiu-
inge the sacramente, must needes there receiue also the na-
tural] substaunce of Christes owne blessed bodye‚ both
fleashe and bloude.

Nowe on the other syde, if after the truthe shall be
truly tryed owte‚ it bc fownd that the substance of breade,
is the materiall substance of the sacrament (althowgh for
the chaunge of the vse, office, and dignitie of the bread,
the bread in dede sacramentally is chaunged into the bodye
of Christ, as the water in Baptisme is sacramentally chaunged
into the fountayyne of regeneracion, and yet the material]
substance therof remayneth all one as was before) ys (1
