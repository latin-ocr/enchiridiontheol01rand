:352 BISHOP TAYLOR'S ADVICE

bering, that as the priest's lips are to preserve knowledge,
so it is his duty to minister a word of comfort in the time
of need.

LXXII. A minister must not stay till he be sent for3
but of his own accord and care go to them, to examine them,
to exhort them to perfect their repentance, to strengthen
their saith, to encourage their patience, to persuade them to
resignation, to the renewing of their holy vows, to the love
of God, to be reconciled to their neighbourS, to make resti-
tution and amends, to confess their sins, to settle their
estate, to provide for their charges, to do acts of piety and

raise him up to vain and unreasonable confidences. But
take care that he be not carelessly dismissed.

LXXVI. In order to these and many other good pur-
poses, every minister ought frequently to converse with his
parishioners; to go to their houses, but always publicly,
with witness, and with prudence, lest what is charitably in-
tended be scandalously reported; and in all your conversa-
