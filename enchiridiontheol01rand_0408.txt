nien were foretold. What then? qust we make God the

author of sin? God forbid. Will the righteous J udge of '.

al} the earth punish mankind for his own acts, which they
could not avoid? T hen we must yield, that there is some-
thing in the manner of the divine prescience which is above
our comprehension. And the most searching and inquisitive
men have been forced to yield it at last, as to the connec-
tion between the certainty of prescience and the liberty of
human actions. Is it not then much better to sit down
quietly at first, adoring the infiniteness of God's incompre-
hensible perfections, than after all the huffings and disput-
ings of men to say, In ignorantia sola quietem invenio, as
the great schoolman did? Surely then here is something
plainly revealed, and yet the manner of it is still a mystery
to US.

I shall not now insist on any more of the particular attri-
butes of God, but only in general Ι desire to know, whe-
ther they believe them to be finite or infinite? If to be
finite, then they must have certain bounds and limits which
they cannot exceed3 and that must either be from the im-
perfection of nature, or from a superior cause, both which
are repugnant to the very being of God. If they believe
them to be infinite, how can they comprehend them? We
are strangely puzzled in plain, ordinary, finite things; but
it is madness to pretend to comprehend what is infinite; and
yet if the perfections of God be not infinite, they cannot be-
long to him. .

I shall only add, in consequence to this assertion, that if
nothing is to be believed but what may be comprehend-
ed, the very being of God must be rejected t00. And
therefore I desire all such who talk so warmly against* any
mysteries in religion, to consider whose work it is they are
doing; even theirs who under this pretence go about to
overthrow all religion. ‘⁶ For? say they, “religion is a
‘⁶ mystery in its own nature3 not this or that, or the other
‘⁶ religion; but they are all alike, all is mystery; and that
‘⁶ is but another name for fraud and imposture. What were
“ the heathen mysteries but tricks of priestcraft; and such
