THE CATHECHISME. 23

circumstaunces these thinges shal come to passe, I would
fayne heare thee tell.

Scholer.1 will tell you as well as I can, accordyng toThe ulos
the wytnesse of the same apostle. The heauens shall passe the wo ⁰¹d’
awaye like a storme: the elementes shal melt awaye: the
earthe, and all the workes therein shall bee consumed wyth
fyre: as thoughe he shulde say: as gould is wont to be
fined: so shal the whole world be purified with fire, and be
broughte to hys full perfection. The lesser world, whiche
is man, folowynge the same, shall lykewyse bee delyuered

worlde (which for hys sake was first created) shall at length
be renewed: and be clad wyth another heW‚ much more

throwen from thense into euerlastynge syre, appoynted for
the Deuyll and hys angelles.
