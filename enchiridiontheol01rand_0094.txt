80 RIDLEY AGAINST

that which is in Luke and Paule. The old Authors doo
most reherse the fourme of wordes in Matthew‚ and Marke,
because (I wene) they semed to them most cleare. But
here I wold knowe, whether it is credible or no, that Luke,
and Paule, when they celebrated the Lordes supper whith
their congregations‚ that they didde not vse the same forme
of woordes at the Lordes table whiche they wrotte, Luke
in hys Gospelh and Paule in his Epistell.

Of Luke because he was a Phisition, whether some will
graunt that he mighte be a Priest or no, and was able to
receiue the order of Priesthode‚ which (they say) is geuen
by virtue of these words said by the Byshoppe (take thou
autoritie to sacrifice for the quick and the dead) I can not
tel. But if they shoulde be so straite vpon Luke, either
for his craft, or els for lacke of suche power geuen hym by
vertue of the aforesaide wordes, then I ‘wene both Peter
and Paul are in danger to be deposed of their priestehode,
for the craste, either of fishing, whiche was Peters‚ or of
making tents, which was Pauls‚ were more vile then the
scyence of phisike. And as for those sacramentall wordes
of the order of priesthod‚ to haue authoritye to sacrifyce
both for the quicke and the dead, I wene Peter and Paule,
if they were both aliue were not able to proue that euer
Christ gaue them suche authoritye, or euer sayd any such
wordes vnto them. But I will lett Luke go. And because
Paule speketh more playnely for hymself I will reherse his
wordes.

T hat (sayth Paule) whiche I receaued of the Lorde I
gaue vnto yow: For the Lord Jhesus‚ &c And so he
setteth fourthe the whole institucion and right vse of the
Lordes supper. Nowe seing that Paule here saythe‚ that
which he receiued of the Lord, he had geuen them, and
that which he had receiued‚ and geuen them before by
word of mowthe, nowe he reherseth and writeth the same
in his epistle, ys it credible that Paule wold neuer vse this
foul-me of wordes vppon the Lordes cuppe, whiche (as he
saithe) he receiued of the Lord, that he had giuen them
before, and nowe reherseth in his epistle? Itrust no man
