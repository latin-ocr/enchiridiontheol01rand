32 THE CATHECHISME.

Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth as it is in
heaven. Gyue vs thys day our dayly bieade, and forgyue
vs our trespasses as we forgyue them that trespasse agaynste
vs. And lead vs not into temptation : But delyuer vs from

euell. For thyne is the kyngdom, power and glory for euer.
Amen.

Μαίδων. How thinkest thou ? is it lawfull for vs, to vse

and is as necessarye for the lewd as the learned.

Master. Therefore declare vnto me, in fewe woordes,
eche parte by itselfe.

Scholer. When I say, oure father which art in heauen ε
thys do I thincke with my selfe: that it canne not be but
that he must heare me, and be pleased wyth my praiers.
For 1 am hys sonne (although unprofitable and disobedient)
and he on the other side is my moste bountyfull father,
most readye to take pity and pardon me.

Affa'ister. Why doste thou sayc, he is in heauen? is he in
