tians, as well as men, to give a reason os the faith we pro-
fess, and defend it against all false and unjust imputations3
Ι have also made it my business to inquire how far We are
capable of forming distinct conceptions of a Trinity; and
upon inquiry found, that after a faithful trial of our facul-
ties, and a strict examination of all the simple notions which
make up the proposition to be believed, we cannot arrive
at greater knowledge in this point than our forefathers
have done: and that so much of the doctrine of the Trinity
as was a mystery to them, is like to be so to the end of the
world.

Which if Ι have as fully and sufficiently proved to others
as I am convinced of it myself, Ι shall not think my time or
labour lost upon this subject. For next to understanding a
thing throughly, is to know we cannot understand it; next
to resolving a problem in mathematics, is to demonstrate it
cannot be done. Our souls are as much at rest, our desires
as quiet, and all our designs and pursuits as much at an
end, when we despair of victory, as when we actually
conquer.

And therefore if these be the true and proper limits of
our saith and knowledge which I have assigned; if I have
given a just account of what we are required to believe con-
cerning the Trinity3 how much it is possible for us to be-
lieve of it, and how far we are capable of having distinct
conceptions about it; it is in vain to search for new notions
and hypotheses, which may probably puzzle or deceive our
understanding, but can never lead us farther into the know-
ledge of the Trinity.

But I will not pretend to measure the abilities of other
men by my own: I shall only say this more, which I am
sure I can truly affirm, that I have taken all the care ima-
ginable to deliver my judgment impartially and sincerely;
and have not dared to impose any thing upon others, which

I do not believe myself,'0r is in any way inconsistent with
the principles of right reason.
