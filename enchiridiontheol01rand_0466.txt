turning, when any particular scheme or notion they are
fond os is called in question. On the other side, I have
no small reason to believe there are several who strike at.
Christianity itself, under the pretence of bringing down the
value of niysteries.

And indeed if we consider the general temper of man-
kind, it is no wonder that thereis more superstition and
infidelity in the world than true religion: for believing
every thing, and believing nothing, a sudden veneration or
contempt of whatsoever is proposed to us, equally gratify
the lazy inclinations of the soul; which loves an easy un-
disturbed course of thoughts, and is very difficultly brought
to endure the labour of attention and inquiry. Nay, of
those who seem to have conquered this trouble, there are
few who lay themselves out in a free and impartial search
of truth; the greatest part even of these are employed
wholly in the pursuit of some notion they have beforehand
taken up, and are resolved to maintain: they are already
determined what to believe, and only seek out arguments to
justify or recommend their opinions to others.

How far these general reflections are applicable to the
present case, has been hinted at already in the beginning of

point have been vain and unsuccessful, is the want of dis-
cerning or considering the bounds and limits of our know-

strive to soar above our pitch, and imagine we understand
some things better than really we do. But especially men
of abstracted thinking are very apt to deceive themselves
with false ideas, and are firmly persuaded they conceive
things distinctly, which they have but a confused notion of.
As for instance; It has been delivered down, as the con-
stant saith of a long succession of eminent philosopher5‚
