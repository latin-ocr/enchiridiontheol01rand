96 RIDLEY AGAINST

For they will not saie that he is either here, or ther, as in a
place. This answere pleaseth so wel the maker‚ that he
hymseffe, after he hadde played with it a litle whyle, and
shewed the finesse of his witte‚ and eloquence therin‚ he is
contented to geue it ouer, and Saye: But it is not to be
thoughte that Chrisostome woulde speake after this finesse
or subteltie‚ and therefore he returneth againe to the seconde
aunsweare for hys shootte anker whiche is sufficientlye con-
futed before.

Another shorte place of Chrisostome I wyll reherse‚
which (if any indifferencie maie be hem-de) in playne
tearmes setteth fourth the trueth of this matter.

Before the breade (saieth Chrisostome writinge ad Cesa-
rium Monachum) be hallowed, we call it breade, but the
grace of Godde sanctifiyng it by the meanes of the prieste‚
it is deliuered nowe from the name of breade, and esteamed

declare that the bread abideth soe styll ?

And yet this soe plaine a place some are not ashamed thus
shamefullye to elude it, saiynge, wee graunte the nature of
breade remaineth still thus, for that it maie be seen, fealte‚
and tasted, and yet the corporall substaunce of the breade
therfore is gone, lest two bodies be confused together, and
Christ shoulde be thoughte impanate.

What conti-arietie and falsehoode is in this answeare, the
simple manne maye easilie perceiue. Is not this a plaine
contrarietie to graunt that the nature of breade remaineth
so still, that it maie bee seen, feaste, and tasted‚ and yet to
saie the corporall substance is gone, to auoide absurditie of
Christes impanation?

And what manifest faisehoode is this to say, or meane,
that yf the breade shoulde remayne styll‚ then muste fol-
lowe the inconuenyence of impanation, as thoughe the verie
breade coulde not be a Sacramente of Christes bodye, as
water is of Baptisme, excepte Christe sh0uIde vnite the na- ⁴
