90 RIDLEY AGAINST

which wil vouchsafe to read them, and withoute preiudice
of a corrupte iudgement will indifferently wey them, and con-
strue their miudes none otherwise, then they declare them
selfes to haue meant, Ι am perswaded I saye, that in reding
of them thus, no man can be ignorant in this matter, but
he that will shutt vpp his owne eies and blindfeld hym self.

When I speake of ecclesiastieal writers, I meane of such,
as were before the wicked vsurpation of the Sea of Rome
was growne so vnmeasurablie greate, that not onely with
tyrannicall power, but also with corrupt doctrine, yt be-
ganne to subuerte Christes gospell, and to turne the state
that Christ and his Apostles sett in the church vpside
downe.

For the causes aforesayd Ι will reherse certayne of their
sainges, and yet because I take them but for wytnesses and
expownders of this doctrine, and not as the Authors of the
same;' and also for that nowe I will not be tedyous, I will
reherse but fewe, that is, three olde wryters of the Greke
churche, and other three of the Latine church, which do
seem vnto me to be in this matter most plain.

The Greke authours are Origen, Chrysostome, and The-
odoret: The Lattin, are Tertullian, S. Austin, and Gela-
sius. ’

I knowe there can be nothing spoken so plainly, but the
eraftye wit furnished with Eloquence ean darcken it, and
wrest it quite from the true meaning to a contrarie sense ε
And I knowe also that eloquence, crafte and fiuesse of
witte, hath gone about to bleare mens eyes, and to stoppe
their eares in the aforenamed writers, that menne shoulde
neither heare nor see, what those authoures boeth write and
teache soe plainelye, that excepte menne should be made
both starke blinde, and deafe, they can not but of necessitie,
if they will reade and weye them indifferentelye, boeth heare
and see what they doe meane, when eloquence, crafte‚ and
{inesse of witte, haue done all that they canne. Now lette
vs heare the olde writers of the Greke churche.
