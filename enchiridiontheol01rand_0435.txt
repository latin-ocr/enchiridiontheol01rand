TRANSUBSTANTIATION COMPARED. 421

God but one ,- therefore no creature can be made God:
And to us there is but one God, the Father ,· therefore the
Son cannot be God. If therefore the name Lord be taken
in opposition to Goel, then Christ cannot be God in any
sense; for we must have but one God: but the plain mean-
ing of the apostle was, that by one Lord he meant one Me-
diator, by whom alone we have, in this new frame of things
by the gospel, access unto God the Father.

The third place, 1 Cor. xv. 27, 28. speaks plainly of
Christ's kingdom, as Mediator.

The fourth place, Rev. iii. 12. where Christ speaks seve-
ral times of my God, proves no more than his words on the
cross, My God, ‘my Gocl, why least tlzoufi2=rsaken me? For
surely Christ might own a particular relation to God, and
interest in him, as he was in human nature, without over-
throwing the divine nature in him.

P. But he ownS, that though he is to be our Judge, he
knows not the time, Mark xiii. 32. which seems inconsistent
with the divine nature, which knoweth all things,

Pr. The Son there spoken of was Christ, as endued with
a human soul, when he was upon earth3 which could not
understand a secret so much out of the reach of man's un-
derstanding, without immediate revelation. But it was not
necessary, by virtue of the union of both natures, that the
divine nature should communicate to the human soul of
Christ all divine mysteries3 but as the human body was
notwithstanding subject to passions and infirmities incident
to it, so the human soul might continue ignorant of the day
of judgment in this state; both to let us know how great
that secret is, and that Christ had the proper capacity of a
human soul, which could not extend to such things without
divine revelation.

P. There is one argument more, which seems to prove
Christ's divinity, and doth n0t3 viz. The making of all
thing-9 visible and invisible, being attributed to him, John
i. 3. Heb. i. 10. Col. i. 16, 17, 18, 19.

Pr. Now I confess this doth more than seem to me to
be a very strong argument; and that for this reason: the
