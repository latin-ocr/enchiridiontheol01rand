TRANSUBSTANTIATION COMPARED. 431

hinder our faith. And Ι have made some advance towards
the explication of it, by shewing, that since mankind are
agreed about the difference between nature and person,
the whole difficulty comes to this, that the same common
nature in mankind makes three persons3 but that it is the
same individual nature in all the Persons of the Trinity.

And now let us consider the infinite perfection and sim-
plicity of the divine nature; and we shall think it unreason-
able that it should be bounded as to the manner of its com-
munication, as the nature of man is. Every individua] man
hath not only individual propertieS, but an individual na-
ture, i. e. the common nature of man, limited by some unac-
countable principle, that doth make him different from all
other men having the same nature with himself. The diffl-
culty then doth not lie in a community of nature, and a dis-
tinction of persons, for that is granted among men; but in
the unity of nature with the difference of personS. And
supposing the divine nature to be infinite in its perfection,
1 do not see how it is capable of being bounded, as the
common nature of man in individuals is; and if it be not
capable of being bounded and limited, it must diffuse itself
into all the persons in the same individual mannen and so
this doctrine of the Trinity is not repugnant to reason.

P. But what say you to the Athanasian Creed3 is not
that repugnant to human reason?

Pr. I think n0t; but that it is a just explication of the
doctrine of the Trinity rightly understood.

P. I see, now you are upon hard points, you will stick at
nothing, and transubstantiation itself will down with yon
anon.

Pr. I doubt not3 but at present we are upon the Atha-
nasian Creed. And I desire but one principle to clear it,
which follows from what is said already, viz. That what is
affirmed of the divine nature, as such, must be common to
all three Persons; but whatever is affirmed of the several
Persons, as such, must be peculial· to themselves. Now this
is a clear principle of reason, and hath no appearance of ab-
surdity init. And from hence the Athanasian Creed will
