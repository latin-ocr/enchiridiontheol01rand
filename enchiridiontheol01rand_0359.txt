TO HIS CLERGY. 345

the people is the one half of his great office and employ-
ment.

XLI. Let every minister be careful that what he deli-
vers be indeed the word of God; that his sermon may be
answerable to his text3 for this is God's word, the other
ought to be according to it; that although in itself it be but
the word of man, yet by the purpose, truth, and significa-

XLII. Do not spend your sermons in general and inde-

them to revile their betters, and neglect the dangers of their
own souls.

XLV. As it looks like ,fiattery and design to preach no-
thing before magistrates but the duty of their people and
their own eminency; so it is the beginning of mutiny to
