his, that (this) was then in dede Christes bodye, thowgh
the word did not import so muche, but onely one thing in
substance, which substance after Duns, the breade being
gone, must nedes be the substance of Christes bodye.

But they that putt their transubstantiacion to be wrought
by these wordes of Christ, This is my bodye, and doo saye
that when the hole sentence was finished, then this chaunge
was perfected, and not before, they can not saie, but yet

Ambidexters, or rather suche as canne shifte on both sides.
They plaic on boeth partes; for with the latter they doe
