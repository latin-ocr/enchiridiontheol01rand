454 BISHOP GASTRELL

tural sentiments, and draw all my reflections from thence;
taking only such which easily, and without constraint,
offered themselves.

II. And thus having cleared the way, and removed every
thing which Ι thought might obsti uct or misguide my in-
quiiies, Ι come, 1n othe second place, to consider the doc-
trine itself3 and faithfully and lmpar tially to examine what
is sufficient for Christians to believ e concerning the Trinity,
or, which is al] one in this case, what is necessary to be be-
lieved. For certainly he believes enough, and cannot in
reason be taxed for a narrow defective faith, who believes
as much as is required of him.

For the better proceeding in which inquiry, 1 shall lay
down this as an evident truth, which every man will grant
me, that nothing 1s necessary to be believed, but, 1. what is
possible to be believed; and, Q’what 15 plainly revealed.

But 11616 Ι would be understood, as to the last part of
the assertion, only of such matters which are known to us
no other way than by revelation. For in several other
cases, I confess, we may be obliged to believe merely upon
human testimony: nay, even revelation itself, as it 15 3 11131-
ter of fact, claims our assent upon no higher a ground.

But further, 1 shall take this for granted too in a pro-
testant country, that scripture is the only standard of all ne-
cessary revealed truths: neither in the present instance is
there any room for a traditionary faith. For, besides that
all the fathers and ancient writers ground their expositions
of the Trinity wholly upon scripture, I cannot conceive that
the subject is capable of a plainer revelation, as Ι shall en-
deavour to shew more fully m 1116 following discourse.

We are therefore, 111 1116 filst place, to considet how far
it is possible to belleve the Trinity; and next, to examine
what the sc11ptu1e requiies us 10 believe m this matter.

Now there are two considerations requisite to make it
possible for us to believe a thing. 1. That we know the
terms of what we are to assent to. 2. That it imply no
contradiction to our former knlowledge3 such knowledge 1
mean which is accompanied with certainty and evidence.
