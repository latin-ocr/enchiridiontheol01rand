26 THE CATHECHISME.

Maeter. That it is in dede: and so it shal be good for
ye to do.
Sclwler. That congregation is nothing elsse but a cer-

e, tayne multytude of menne: which, whersoeuer they be,

professe the pure and vprighte learning of Christ, and that
in such sort, as it is faithfully set fourth in the holye Testaf
ment, by the euangelists and apostles: whiohe in al points,
are goucrned and ruled by the lawes and statutes of theyr
Kinge and hye Byshoppe Christe, in the bonde of charity:
which vse his holy misteryes‚ that are commonlie called saf-
eramentes, with such purenesse and simplicity (as touchinge
theire nature and substaunce) as the apostles of Christ vsed

ο and left behinde in writing. The marekes therefore of this
ς’· churche are: firste, pure preachyng of the gospel: then

brotherly loue, out of which as members out of al one body,
springeth good wyl of eche to other: thirdly vprighte and
vncorrupted vse of the Lordes sacraments‚ accordynge to
the ordynaunce of the gospell: laste of all brotherlye cor-
rection, and excommunication, or banishynge those out of
the church, that wyl] not amend their liues. This marcke
the holye fathers termed discipline. This is that same
churche‚ that is grounded vpon the assured rocke J esus
Christ and vpon trust in hym. This is that same chureh,
which Paul calleth the piller‚ and vpholding stay of truth.

o To this church belong the keies, whearwyth heauen is

locked and vnlocked: for that is done by the ministration
of the worde: wherunto properly appertayneth the power
to bynde and louse: to holde for gyhy, and forgiue synnes.
So that whosoeuer beleueth the gospell preached in thys
church, he shal be saued: but whoso beleueth not, he shal
be dampned.

Master. Now wold 1 fain heare thy beliefe of the Holy
Ghost.

Scholer. I confesse, him to be the thyrd person of the
holy Trinitie: and sith he is equal with the Father and the
Sonne‚ and of tho verye same nature, that he ought ogally
to bec worshipped with then] bothe=

Affaster. Whi is he called holy?
