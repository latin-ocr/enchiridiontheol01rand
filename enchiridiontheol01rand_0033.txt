THE CATHECHISME. 19

his church: euen to the end of the world. Yet thys prou- Christes
eth not that he is present among vs in his body. For his Ξξέζζζαρ
Godhead hath one propertye: his manhead another. Hys
manhead was create: his Godhed vncreate. His manhead

is in some one place of heauen : his Godhed is in such sort

ech wher, that it filleth both heauen and earthe. But to
make thys point plainer, by a similitude or comparing of

like to like. Ther is nothyng that doth trulier‚ like a sha- Christe
dow, expres Christ, then the sonne: for it is a fit image Ofggngffired
the light and brightnes of Christ. The sonne doth alway 8888888
kepe the heauen: yet do we sai that it is present also in the
world: for without lyght thear is nothyng present, that is
tosay, nothyng to be seen of any man: for the sonne wyth

hys lyghte fulfilleth al things. So Christ is lyfted vp
aboue all heauens, that he maye be present wyth all, and

fully furnyshe all things as St. Paul doth saye. But as
touchynge the bodylye presence of Christe heare in earthe

(if it be lawfull to place in comparison great thinges wyth
small) Christes bodye is present to our faith : as the sonne,
when it is seen, is present to the eye: the bodie wherof, al-
though it do not bodylye touche the eye, nor be presently

wyth it together hear in earthe‚ yet is it present to the
sight, notwithstanding so large a distaunce of space betwen.

So Christes body which at his glorious going vp was con-
ueyed from vs: which hath left the worlde, and is gone

vnto hys F ather: is a greate way absent from our mouth,

euen then when we receyue wyth our mouth the holye

⁷ sacrament of his body and bloude. Yet is oure fayth in
heauen: and beholdeth that sonne of righteousnesse: and

is presently together wyth him in heauen, in sutch sort as

the syghte is in heauen with the body of the sonne: or in
earthe the sonne wyth the syght. And as the sonne is pre-

sent to all thinges by hys light: so is Christe also in hys
Godhead. Yet neither can from the body the light of the
sonne be sondred: nor from hys immortall bodye the God-

head of Christe. We muste thearfore so saye, that Christes

bodye is in some one place of heanen, and hys Godhead
