TRANSUBSTANTIATION. 75

And now leste thou justly maist complaine‚ and saie
that Ι have in openinge of this matter doone nothing els
but digged a pitte, and have not shutt it up agaim, or
broken a gap, and have not made it up, or opened the
booke and have not closed it again, or elles to call me
what thou listest‚ as Newtrall‚ Dissembler, or what soeuer
els thy Iuste and learning shall serue thee to name me
worse: Therfore here nowe Ι will by Goddes grace not
onlye shortly, but also so clearely and plainelie as I can,
make the nowe to knowe whether of the foresaide two
aunsweres to the former principall state and chief pointe
doth like me beste. Yea and also I will holde all those

long as I maie, shall freelye set furth that whiche vndoubt-

And yet l will doe it vnder this protestation‚ call me a pro-

shall be this, that my minde is, and euer shal be (God will-

the bestc of myne vnderstanding‚ of Gods most holye worde,
and not to decline from the same, either for feare of world-
ly danger, or els for hope of gaino. Ι do protest also dew
