456 BISHOP GASTRELL

by which I am satisfied of the truth of something which 1
did not believe or know before.

From whence it follows, that terms and simple ideas
must be clearly and distinctly understood first, before we
can believe any thing particular of the respects and relae
tions they bear to one another, which is the only proper ob-
ject of saith.

Another condition necessary to render a thing capable of
being believed is, that it implies no contradiction to our
former knowledge: I cannot conceive how it is possible to
give our assent to any thing that contradicts the plain dic-
tates of our reason, and those evident principles from
whence we derive all our other knowledge.

As for example3 I do not see how any authority of re-
velation can overthrow the truth of this proposition, That
the whole is bigger than any of its parts. For,

First, Ι cannot more clearly and distinctly perceive any
externa] impressions made upon my soul, nor be more cer-
tain that such impressions proceed from God, than I can
perceive, and be assured, that the ideas I have of whole and
part bear this relation to one another.

Secondly, The nature and constitution of things makes 1t
impossible that this proposition should be false; for such
and such things or notions being supposed, such and such
habitudes and respects must necessarily result from them.
So long therefore as Ι have the same ideas of whole and
part, and the same faculties of perception, I shall always
perceive the same relation betwixt them: and if my ideas
of whole and part were changed, or a new texture and
frame of soul given me, I should indeed perceive different
relations betwixt these new ideas3 but this would by no
means destroy the truth of my former conceptions3 it
would still be certain, according to the ideas I had before
of whole and part, that the whole was bigger than any of
its parts: which ideas will always unalterably have the
same relation to one another. But,

Thirdly, VVas it possible this proposition could be false,
considering only the nature of the things themselves, the
