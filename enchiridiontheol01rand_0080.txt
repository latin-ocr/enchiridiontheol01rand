66 RIDLEY AGAINST

Christe, hathe troubled not of late onlie thy churche of
England, Fraunee‚ Germany, and Italye, but also manie
yeares agoe. The fault is oures no doubt thereos, for we
haue deserued thy plage.¹ But, O Lorde, be mercifull and

relieue our miserie, with some light of grace. Thou know-
est, O Lorde, howe this wicked worlde rolleth vp and doune,
and rieleth to and fro, and careth not what thy wil is, so it
may abide in welth. Yf truth haue wealth‚ then who are
so stoute to defende the truth as they. But if Christes
crosse bee laiede on truethes backe, then they vanishe
straighte awaie as waxe before the fiere. But these are not
they, O heauenly father, for whome I make my most mone,
but for those selye ones Ο Lorde, which haue a zeale unto
thee, those I meane which woulde and wishe to know thy
will, and yet are lette, holde hacke, and blinded by the sub-
tilties of Sathan, and his ministerS, the wickedness of this
wretched world, and the sinfull lustes and affections of the
fleashe. Alasse, Lorde, thou knowest that we be of oure-
selues but fleshe, wherein there dwelleth nothing that is
good. How then is it possible for man, without thee, (O
Lorde) to understande thy truthe in deede. Can the natu-
rall man perceive the will of God? O Lorde, to whome thou
geuest a zeale of thee, geue them also we beseeche the
knowledge of thy blessed will„ Suffer not them, O Lorde,
blindelie to bee ledde for to striue against thee, as thou didst
those (alas) whiche crucified thine owne deare sonne. For-
giue them, O Lorde, for thy dear sonnes sake for they
knowe not what they doe. They do thinke‚ (alas) O Lorde
for lacke of knowledge, that they doe unto thee good seruice,
euen when againste thee they do moost greuouselie rage.
Remembre, O Lorde, we besech the for whome thy Martir
Steuen did praie‚ and whome thy holy Apostle did so true-
lye and earnestly loue, that for their saluation he wished
hymselfe accursed from thee. Remembre, O heauenlye fa-
ther, the prayer of thy deare sonne oure Sauioure Christe
upon the Crosse, when hee said unto thee, O father for-
geue them, they knowe not what they do. With this for-
geuenes (O good Lord) geue me I beseeehe the thy grace
