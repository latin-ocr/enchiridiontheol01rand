98 RIDLEY AGAINST

them, that the trueth whiche is so plainlie tolde, shoulde not
haue place.

This authour wrote, saie they, before the determination
of the church. As who would saie, whatsoeuer that wicked
man Innocentius the Pope of Rome determined in his con-
gregacions, with his monkes and friers, that must bee (for
so Duns saieth) holden for an article, and of the substaunce
of oure saith.

Some do charge this authour that he was suspected to be
a Nestorian, which thing in Chalcedon Councell was tried
and proued to be false.

But the foulest shift of all, and yet the beste that they
eanne finde in this matter, when none other will serue, is to

not saie but he is worthye in the Lawe to be retained of
Counsell, that canne glose soe well, and fynd in a matter of
dyfficultie suche fyne shyftes, and yet this is the Lawe, or

tell what parrell a manne maye incnrre to speake against it,
excepte he were a lawyer in dcede, whiche caune kepe him-
selfe out of the briars, what wynde soeuer blowe.

Hitherto yee haue harde three writers of the Greke
Churche, not all what they doe saie, for that were a laboure
to greate for to gather, and to tedyous for the reader, but
one or two places of euerye one. The whiche howe plaine,
and howe full, and cleare they bee againste the crroure of
