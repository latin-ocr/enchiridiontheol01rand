great reason to believe it; but from hence it appears that
our reason may oblige us to believe some things which it is
not possible for us to comprehend. We know that either
God must have been for ever, or it is impossible he ever
should be, for if he should come into being when he was
not, he must have some cause of his being; and that which
was the first cause would be God. But if he was for ever,
he must be from himself ς and what notion or conception
can we have in our minds concerning it? And yet, athe-
istical men can take no advantage from hence; because
their own most absurd hypothesis hath the very sanie diffi-
culty in it. For something must have been for ever. And
it is far more reasonable to suppose it of an infinite and
eternal mind, which hath wisdom and power and goodness
to give being to other things, than of dull, stupid, and
senseless matter, which could never move itself, nor give
being to any thing besides. Here we have therefore a
thing which must be owned by all; and yet such a thing
which can be conceived by none :· which shews the narrow-
ness and shortness of our understandings, and how unfit
they are to be the measures of the possibilities of things.
Vai‘n ‘men would be τώδε,- they would fain go to the very
bottom of things, when, alas! they scarce understand the
very surface of them. They will allow no mysteries in re-
ligion; and yet every thing is a mystery to them. They cry
out of cheats and impostors under the notion of mysteries;
and yet there is not a spire of grass but is a mystery to
them. They will bear with nothing in religion which they
cannot comprehend3 but above other things the divine per-
fections, even those which are most absolute and necessary
are above their reach. For let such men try their imagina-
tions about GotPs eternity, not merely how he should be
from himself, but how God should co-exist with all the dif-
ferences of times, and yet there be no succession in his own
being. I do not say there is such difficulty to conceive a
rock standing still when the waves run by it; or the gno-
mon of a dial when the shadow passeth from one figure to
another; because these are gross unactivc things; but the
