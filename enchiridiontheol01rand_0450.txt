436 DOCTRINE OF THE TRINITY AND

Pr. I say both of them hinder. For a true body can no
more be without its dimensions, than a line without divisi-
bility.

P. I grant, that naturally it cannot, but by divine power
it may.

Pr. Will you make the power of God to change the es-
sential properties of things, while the things themselves re-
main in their true nature? You may as well say, that natu-
rally man is a reasonable creature3 but by divine power he
may be a true man, and yet want the faculty of reasoning:
that naturally two and two make four, but God can make
two and two to be joined together in a supernatural manner,
so that four shall not result from them; that though, natu-
rally speaking, whitewashing a wall makes it look white, yet
by an extraordinary power, there may be the presence of
all things which make a wall white, yet it shall not do so3
just so it is to make a body present, and yet to have no di-
mensions of a body. Is there any real difference between
the nature of a body and spirit? Wherein lies it? Is it not
as repugnant for a body to be after the manner of a spirit,
as for a body and spirit to be the same?

P. All this proceeds upon not considering the difference
between the essential eoetensz‘on of a bodz , and that which is
quantitative, and laath relation to place.

Pr. The assentiat extension of a body without quantity]
is nonsense, and a contradiction. For it is to make a body
extended and not extended at the same time. I pray tell
me what you mean by a body, as it is opposed to a spirit .9

P. I mean as all mankind do, such a substance which con-
sists of parts extended and divisible.

Pr. Then being extended and divisible are the natural
and essential properties of a body. And therefore, to sup-
pose a body not to be extended and divisible, is to suppose
it not to be a body, which is a plain contradiction.

P. You are to distinguish between the intrvtnsecal quan-
titgy, which is an inseparable property of a body, and the
emtrinsecal relation it hath to a place. ³

Pr. Intrinsecal quantity without relation to place, is in-
