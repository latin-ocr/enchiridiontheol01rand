484· BISHOP GASTRELL

which cannot be conceived, but confusedly and indistinctly;
nor expressed‚ but in general and obscure terms. For where
is the hardship of being required to believe as far as we can
believe? God is incomprehensible in his nature and perfec-
tions; but are we not obliged to believe there is a God who
is incomprehensible? Are we not obliged to believe there
are joys in heaven, which it has not entered into the heart

A threefold distinction in the Godhead‚ consistent with

III. And now what (langerous consequences can possibly
attend such a saith as this? It is true indeed that the ad-
versaries of the Trinity have drawn up a heavy charge
against this doctrine, and taken a great deal of liberty in
their discourses about it: but the principal objections that
have been made by any of them are but three, to which all
the rest may be reduced: and these I shall endeavour to
shew, by the account before given, are very frivolous and
unjust.

1. The first pernicious consequence the doctrine of the
Trinity stands charged with is, the introduction of a plu-
rality of Gods: but it is very plain, from what we have said
in the former part of this discourse‚ that it is utterly impos-
sible to believe a Trinity in any such sense as implies a plu-
