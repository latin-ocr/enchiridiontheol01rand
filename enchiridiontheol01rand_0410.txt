5396 BISHOP STILLINGFLEET

presses it in the beginning of his Gospeh) than in supposing
that although John the Baptist were born six months be-
fore J esus Christ, that yet Christ was in dignity before him.
What a wonderful mystery is this! Can men have the face
to cry down mysteries in deep speculations, and matters of
a high and abstruse nature, when they make such mysteries
of plain and easy things? and suppose the evangelist in
profound language and lofty expressions to prove a thing
which was never disputed‚ viz. that although Christ Jesus
were born six months after John, yet he was in dignity be-
fore him Ρ

(2.) It is a more reasonable thing to suppose that a di-
vine person should assume human nature, and so the Word
to be made fleslz›‚· than to say, that an attribute of God, his
wisdom or power, is made flesh, which is a mystery beyond
all comprehension. There may be some difficulties in our
conception of the other, but this is a thing beyond all con-
ception or imagination3 for an accident to be made a sub-
stance is as absurd‚ as to imagine it to subsist without one.

(3.) It is more reasonable to suppose that the Son of
God should come down from heaven and take our nature
upon him, than that a man should be rapt up into heaven,
that it might be said that he came down from thence. For
in the former supposition we have many other places of
scripture to support it, which speak of his being· with God,
and having· glor-y with Irim before the world wan whereas
there is nothing for the other, but only that it is necessary
10 make some tolerable sense of those word-s.

(4.) It is more reasonable to believe that God should be-
come man by taking our nature upon him, than that man
should become God. For in the former, there is nothing
but the difficulty of conceiving the manner of the union,
which we all grant to be so between soul and body3 but in
the other there is a repugnancy in the very conception of a
created God, of an eterna] son of Adam, of omnipotent in-
firmity, of an infinite finite Being. In the former case, an

infinite is united to a finite; but in the other a finite be-
comes infinite.
