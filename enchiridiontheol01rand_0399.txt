position, as founded on scripture and the general consent
of the Christian church.

(4.) That which best agrees with the characters of those
persons from whom we receive the Christian faith3 and
those are, Christ J esus and his holy apostles. For, if their
authority be lost, our religion is gone; and their authority
depends upon their sincerity and faithfulness, and care to in-
form the world aright in matters of so great importance.

(1.) 1 begin with the character which the apostles give
of Christ J esus himself ς which is, that he was a person of
the greatest humility and condescension, that he did not
assume to himself that which he might justly have done.
For let the words of St. Paul be understood either as to the

at that time far greater and diviner exeellency in him than
the world would believe. Less than this cannot be made
of those words of the apostle, Who being in the jbrm of P11it.ii.6‚7.

he was far from drawing the people after him, by setting
forth his own perfection3 yet upon just occasions, when the
Jews contested with him, he did assert such things, which
must savour of vanity and ostentation, or else must imply
that he was the eternal Son of God. For all mankind are
agreed that the highest degree of ambition lies in affecting
divine honour, or for a mere man to be thought a God.
How severely did God punish Herod for being pleased
with the people's folly in crying out, The voice of God, Aetsxii. η.
and not cfman! And therefore he could never have borne
with such positive assertions and such repeated defences of
his being the Son of God in such a manner as implied his
