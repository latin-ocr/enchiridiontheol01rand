ΟΝ SCRIPTURE MYSTERIEs. 395

‘⁶ are maintained and kept up in all kinds of religion. If
“ therefore these men, who talk against mysteries, under-
“ stand themselves, they must in pursuance of their prin-

‘⁶ as long as they belie've an infinite and incomprehensible
“ Being, it is nonsense to reject any other doctrine, which

But yet these very men, who seem to pursue the conse-
quence of this principle to the utmost, must assert some-
thing more incomprehensible than the being of God. For
I appeal to any man of common understanding‚ whether it
be not more agreeable to reason to suppose works of skill,
beauty‚ and order to be the effects of a wise and intelligent

have no reason to find fault with the mysteries of religion
because they are incomprehensible, since there is nothing so
absurd and incomprehensible as their darling hypothesis3
and, there is nothing which can make it prevail, but to sup-
pose mankind to be as dull and insensible as the first chaos.

Thus Ι have shewn, that it is not unreasonable for God
to require from us thc belief of something which we cannot,
comprehend.

(2.) I now come to consider, whether those who are so
afraid of incomprehensible niysteries in our saith, have made
it so much more easy in the way they have taken. And not-
withstanding all the hectoring talk against mysteries and
things incomprehensible in religion, I find more insuper-
able difficulties in point of reason in their way than in ourS.
As for instance,

(1.) It is a inore reasonable thing to suppose something
mysterious in the eternal Son of God's being· with the F a-
tlcet· hqfore the world was made bys him, (as St. John ex—
