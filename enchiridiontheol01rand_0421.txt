ΤΗ Ε

DOCTRINE

OF THE

TRINITY

AND

TRANSUBSTANTIATION

COMPARED.

 

Pr. Ι ΗΟΡΕ you are now at leisure to proceed with your
parallel between the doctrine of the Trinity and transub-
stantiation‚ as to scripture and reason.

P. Yes, and am resolved to make good all that I have
said, as to both those.

Pr. And if you do, Ι will yield the cause.

P. I begin with scripture. And the whole dispute as
to both depends on this: Whether the scripture is to be
understood literally or figuratively. If literally, then tran-
substantiation stands upon equal terms vwith the Trinity; if
figurafively, then the Trinity can no more be proved from
scripture, than transubstantiation.

Pr. As though there might not be reason for a figura-
tive sense in one place, and a literal in another.

P. It seems then you resolve it into reason.

Pr. And I pray, into what would you resolve it? Into
no reason ?

Ρ. Into the authority of the church.

Pr. Without any reason.

P. No: there may be reason for that authority, but not
for the thing which I believe upon it.
