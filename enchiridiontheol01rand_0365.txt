all things, what are the issues of eternity3 glories never *to
cease, pains never to be ended.

LXVIII. Let every minister exhort his people to a fre-
quent confession of their sins, and a declaration of the state
of their souls; to a conversation with their minister in spi-
ritual things, to an inquiry concerning all the parts of their
duty; for by preaching, and catechising, and private inter-

repentance and mortification, who never fast; so they give

the bishop at the visitation, or other solemn times of his

also take care that all young persons may by understanding
the principles of religion, their vow of baptism, the excel-

of it, and of living according to it, be fitted and disposed,
and accordingly by them presented to the bishop, that he

may pray over them, and invocate the Holy Spirit, and mi-
nister the holy rite of confirmation.
