ΟΝ ΤΗΕ TRINITY. 479

as the human sou] is perceived to do in any other man; as
appears from his absolute security from all manner of sin
and error, from his constant knowledge of the thoughts and
designs of men, and the will and decrees of God3 and from
his readiness and ability to work miracles at any time, and
upon any occasion. All which are manifest tokens of an
uninterruptcd presence and concurrence of the Deity; espe-
cially if we consider the calmness and evenness of spirit ob-
servable in our Saviour, entirely free from all the transports
of overruling impressions, it is a further *argument that hc
did not receive the Spirit of God at times, or by measure;
but was as conscious of all the divine perfections in himself
as a man is conscious of his own thoughts.

Such are the grounds we find in scripture for those parti-
cular explications of the Trinity before mentioned.

In the next place we are to inquire what the scriptures
necessarily oblige us to believe in this point.

But before this question can be resolved, there are two
things to be premised:

(1.) T hat whatever articles of saith are absolutely neces-
sary to salvadon, all persons of every rank and condition are
equally obliged to believe them. There is not one religion
for the peasant, and another for the scholar: we have the
same general rule to wall< by, though particular obligations
may be greater or lesser, fewer or more, according to dif-
ferent circumstances and relations. And whatever princi-
ples and duties are of general necessity, ought to be so
plainly revealed, as to be easily understood by ordinary ca-
pacities upon a fair and careful examination.

2. That in order to this end it seems to have been the
design of the scriptures to represent God in a sensible man-
ner; though at the same time they take care to assure us
that God is in his own nature a being of different perfec-
tions not conceivable by human understanding; and is thus
represented only in condescension to our weakness, for the
help and assistance of our devotion. So that all expressions
of this kind, where God is the subject, are to be understood
in a higher and more spiritual sense, but still with some
analogy to what they properly and usually signify. Thus,
