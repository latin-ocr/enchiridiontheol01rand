Here Matthew and Marke doo agree not onely in the
matter, but also allmost fullye in the fourme of wordes.
Sauing that for thies wordes in Mathew (gaue thankes)
Marke hath one word (blessed) which signifieth in this
place al one. And wher Matthew saithe (of this fruyte of
the vyne) Marke leaueth owt the worde (this) and saith, of
the fruyte of the vyne.

Nowe lett vs see likewise what agrem-ent in forme of
wordes is betwixe St. Luke and St. Paule.

Luke Vuriteth thus. He toke breade, gaue thankes‚
brake it and gaue it to them saing: This is my bodye vuich
is geuen for you. This doo in remembraunce of me.
Likevuise also vuhen they had supped he tooke the eupp
saynge, This cupp is the nevve testament in my bloud
vuich is shed for you.

St. Paule setteth fourthe Christes supper thus, the Lord
Ihesus the same night in the vuieh he vuas betrayed, tooke
bread‚ and gaue thankes, and brake, and said, Take, eate,
this is my bodie vuiehe is broken for you. This doo in
remembrance of me. After the same manner he tooke the
cupp vuhen supper vuas done, sai-ng, This cupp is the nevue
testament in my bloud. This doo as often as ye drinke it,
in the remembraunee of me: for as ofte as ye shall eate this
bread‚ and drinke this cuppe, ye shall shevue the Lordes
death tyll he comme.

Here wher Luke sayth (which is geuen) Paule saythe
(which is broken). And as Luke addeth to the wordes of
Paule spoken of the cuppe (which is shedd for you) so
likewise Paule addeth to the wordes of Luke (this doo as
often as ye shall drinke it in the remembraunce of me).
The rest that followeth in St. Paule both ther and in the
tenth chapter, perteineth to the right vse and doctrine of
the Lordes supper.

Thus the Evangelistes and St. Paule haue rehersed the
wordes and worke of Christ, wherby he dyd institute and
ordeine this holye sacrament of his blessed bodye and
bloud to be a perpetuall remembraunce of hymself vntill
his comminge againe3 of hymself (I saye) that is of his
