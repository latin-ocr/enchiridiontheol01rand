AN INIUNCTION

Geuen by the kyng our soueraigne lord his most
excellent maiesty to all scholemasters and teach-
ers of youthe‚ within all his graces realme and
dominions, for auctorising and establyshyng the
vse of thys Cathechisme. ’

EDWARDE the Sixte, by the grace of God king of
England‚ Fraunce and Ireland: defendoure of the faith:
and of the church of Englande and also of Ireland in

earthe the supreme head : To all scholemasters and teachers
of youthe.

When there was presented vnto us, to be perused, a
short and playne order of Catechisme written by a certayne
godlye and learned man: we committed the debafinge, and
diligente examination thereos, to certain byshoppes‚ and
other learned men, whose iudgement we haue in greate
estimation‚ And because it semed agreeable with the
scriptures, and the ordynaunces of oure realme, we thought
it good, not onely‚ for that agreement to put it forthe
abrode to print: but also, for the plainesse and shortnes,
to appoint it out for al scholemasters to teach. That the
yet vnskilfull and yong age, hauynge the foundationslayed‚
both of religion and good letters, mai learn godlines to-
gether with wysdome: and haue a rule for the rest of theyr
lyfe, what iudgement they ought to have of God: to whom
all oure lyfe is applyed: and howe they maye please God,
wherin we oughte‚ wyth all the doynges and dutyes of oure

lyfe, to trauayle.
