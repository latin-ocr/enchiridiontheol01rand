TRANSUBSTANTIATION COMPARED. 443

ral councils were so warmly concerned, was only to make
an ecclesiastical dictionary, and to appoint what words are
to be used, and what not. Do you think then there were
no such real heresies as Nestorianism and Eutychianism,
but only they happened to take the words nature and per-

or hell, or the Trinity and incarnadon of Christ, if they
do not believe transubstantiation? We have heard much
of late about old and new popery; but if this be the way
of representing new popery, by exposing the common ar—
ticles of faith, it will set the minds of all good Christians
farther from it than ever. For upon the very same grounds
we may expect another parallel between the belief of a God
