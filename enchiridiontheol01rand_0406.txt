difficulty is far greater where the being is perfect and al-
ways active. For, where there is succession there is a pass-
ing out of not being in such a duration into being in it;
which is not consistent with the absolute perfection of the
divine nature. And therefore God must be all at once
what he is, without any respect to the difference of time
past, present, or to come. From whence eternity was de-
fined by Boethius to be ‘⁶ a perfect and complete possession
⁴⁶ all at once of everlasting life.” But how can we form any
conception in our minds of that being all at once, which
bath such different acts as must be lneasured by a long suc-
cession of time? as, the creating and dissolving the frame
of the world; the promising and sending the Messias; the
declaring and executing a general judgment3 how can these
things be consistent with a permanent instant, or a continu-
ance of being without succession? For, it is impossible for
us in this case, as to God's eternity, to form a clear and dis-
tinct idea in our mind of that which both reason and reve-
lation convince us must be. The most we can make of our
conception of it is, that God hath neither beginning of
being, nor end of days3 but that he always was, and always
must be. And this is rather a necessary conclusion from
reason and scripture, than any distinct notion or conception
of eternity in our minds. From whence it evidently follows,
that God may reveal something to us, which we are bound
to believe, and yet. after that revelation the manner of it
may be incomprehensible by us, and consequently a mystery
to us.

Hath not God revealed to us in scripture the spirituality
of his own nature? that lte is α spirit, and therefore will be
zerorshipped in spirit and z'n t'ruth? For, that is a reason
why spiritual worship should be most agreeable to him.
Now if we could have a clear, distinct, positive notion in
our minds of God's spiritual nature, we might then pretend
that there is nothing mysterious in this, since it is revealed.

But let such men examine their own thoughts about this
matter; and try, whether the utmost they can attain to be
not something negative, viz: because great absurdities would
