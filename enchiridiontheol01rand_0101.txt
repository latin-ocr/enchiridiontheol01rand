TRANSUBSTANTIATION. 87

withowt all dowbte when Christ had taken bread, geuen
thankes, and broken it, and geuing it to his disciples, sayd,
Take, and so demonstrating and shewing that bread which
he had in his handes, to saye then, This is my bodye‚ and
to haue sayd, this bread is my bodye. As it were all one
if a man lacking a knyffe, and going to his oysters, wold
saye to another, whom he sawe to haue 2 knyfes: Syr, I
prayc yow, lend me thone of your knyfes: Were it not
nowe all one to answer him; Syr, hold I will lende yow
this to eate your meate, but not to open oysters withall;
and, hold I will lend yow this knyf to eate your ineate, but
not open oysters? This similitud serueth but for this pur-
pose, to declare the nature of spech whithall, wheras the
thing that is demonstrated and shewed, is euidently perceau-
ed, and openly knowen vnto the eye. But, O good Lord,
what a wonderfull thing is it to see, howe soome men doo
labour to teache, what is demonstrated and shewed by the
pronowne demonstratiue (this) in Christes wordes, when he
saith, This is my bodie, this is my bloud, howe they labour
I saye to teache what that (this) was then in dede, when
Christ spake in the beginning of the sentence the word
(this), before he had pronownced the rest of the wordes
that followed in the sanie sentence, so that their doctrine
maye agree with their transubstantiation, which in dede is
the verye foundacion, wherein all their erroneous doctrine
doth stand. ι

And here the transubstantiators doo not agree amongest
them selfeS, no more then they doo in the wordes which
wrought the transubstantiacion when Christ did first insti-
tute his sacrament. Wherin Innocentius Bishopp of Rome
of the latter dayes, and Duns (as was noted before) do at-
tribute the work vnto the word (benedixit, blessed) But the
rest for the most part to (Hoc est corpus meum, This is my
bodye) ὅτε. Dunse therfore with his secte, because he put-
teth the chaunge before, must nedes saye that (this) when
Christ spake it in the beginning of the sentence was in dede
Christes bodye. For in the chaunge the substance of bread

did departe, and the chaunge was nowe doone in (benedixit,
