TRANSUBSTANTIATION. 79

wine, wherfore the naturali substance of the wine, doeth rc-
maine still in the sacramente of Christes bloude.

And here in spekinge of the Lordes cup, it commeth
vnto my remembrance, the vanitye of Innocentius his
phantasticall inuention, whiche by Paules wordes 1 did
confute before, and here did promise somewhat more to
speake, and that is this. Yf the Transubstantiacion be
made by this worde (Blessed) in Marke saide vpon the
bread, as Innocentius that Pope did saie, then suerlie seing
that worde is not saide of Christe, neither in any of the
Euangelistes, nor in Paule, vpon the cuppe, there is no
Transubstantiation of the wine at all, for where the cause
doth faile there can not folow the effecte. But the sacra-
mentall breade, and the sacramentall wine do both remaine
in their naturall substance alike, and if the one be not
changed, as of the sacramentall wine it appeareth euident-

of them boeth. All that put and afferme this change of
the substaunce of breade and wine into the substance of
Christes body, and bloud (called transubstantiation) doc

oure daies, ahnoste confesse plainelie, that they can not tell.
For although they graunt to certaine of the olde Doctours,
as Chrisostome, and Ambrose, that these wordes (This is
my bodie) are the wordes of Consecration of the sacrament
of the bodie, yet saie they, these wordes maie well bec so
called because they doe assure vs of the Consecration thcrof,
whether it be done before these wordes be spoken or no.
But as for this their doubte concerning the sacrament of the
bodie I let it passe.

Let vs now consider the wordes which pertaine vnto tho
cuppe. This is firste euident, that as Mathewe lnuchc
agreeth with Marke, and likewise Luke with Paul doth
much agree herein in forme of woordcsÍ¾ so in the same,
the forme of wordes in Mathewe and Marke is diuerso from
