mystery of the Trinity‚ without ever looking into it at all3
who think it ought not to be the subject either of dispute
or inquiry3 imagining that every thing of this high and
transcendent nature is proposed to us only as a trial and ex-
ercise of our faith; and the more implicit that is, the fuller
do we express our trust and reliance upon God.

Nay, farther, there are those who do not scruple to say,
the more contradictions the better; the greater the struggle
and opposition of reason, the greater is the triumph and
merit of our faith.

But there is no likelihood of suppressing any of our
doubts or disputes in religion this way: for besides the
natural propension of the soul to the search of truth, and
the strong and impatient desire we have to know as much
as ever we can of what immediately concerns us, it is gene-
rally and very justly looked upon both as the privilege and
duty of man to inquire and examine before he believes or
judges3 and never to give up his assent to any thing but
upon good and rational grounds: and therefore it would be
a very hard thing to persuade the world to stifle and re-
strain so many powerful motives of action. But should
they be farther prevailed upon to go directly contrary to
their reason, it would be much more difficult to conquer the
uneasiness of the reluctance.

And indeed it is well the difficulties of subduing the un-
derstanding are too great to be mastered3 for a slight re-
flection will serve to convince us, that the necessary conse-
quences of a blind resignation of judgment would be more
fatal to Christianity than all our present divisions.

What blasphemies and contradictions may and have been
imposed upon men's belief, under the venerable name of
mysteries? And how easy are villainous practices derived
from an absurd saith? This is matter of common observa-
tion, and has brought a just scandal upon a large party of
Chrisdans, and given occasion to men of light, undistin-
guishing capaciffies, to deny, and scoff at the saving truths

of the gospel‚ because they were accompanied with a ri-
diculous mixture of errors.
