TRANSUBSTANTIATION. 73

saye) the trewe solutyon of that former question, wheruppon
all these controuersies doo hange, be, that the naturall sub-
stance of bread, is the materiall substance in the holie sa-
crament of Christes blessed bodye; then must it followe of
that former proposition confessed of all that be named to
be learned (so farre as Ι knowe) in Englande, whiche is,
that there is but one materiall substance in the sacramente
of the bodie, and one onelye lykewise in the sacrament of
the bloud; that there is no such thing in deede, and in
truth, as they call transubstantiation (for the substance of

But here before we goe any further to searche in this
matter and to wade (as it were) to searche and trie oute
(as we maie) the trueth therof in the scripture, it shall do
well by the way to knowe, whether they that thus make
aunswere and solution to the former principall question,
doe take awaye simplye and absolutlye the presence of
Christes bodie and bloud, from the sacrament ordeined by
Christ, and duely ministred according to his holye ordi-
nance, and institution of the same.

Undoutedlye they do denie that utterly, either so to saie,
or to meane the same. And theros, if any man doe or will
doubte, the bookes which are written alreadye in this mat-
