soul to represent to itself three eternal Beings of coincident
perfectioris. Here is nothing for the imagination to lay hold
of, no manner of ground to deceive ourselves into a confused
belief of such a distinction. And therefore I do not see how
it is possible for us to believe there are three distinct princi-
ples or natures all of the same infinite perfectioris, which to-
gether we call God.

And if there be but one omnipresent‚ infinitely perfect
Being, how can he be truly and fully represented to any
mind under three different ideas? The truth of an idea
consists in ·its agreement and conformity to the original it
represents3 and if so, how is it possible there should be
three ideas exactly and adequately conformable to the same
original, and yet different from one another? Either these
differences found in the ideas are not in the real panem,
and then the representation is false3 or they are, and then
the unity of the object is destroyed.

It is true indeed, we do often apply different ideas to the
same individua] object, but these are either partial and in-
adequate conceptions of the nature and essence of it; or ex-
pressive of something accessory and extrinsecal to the nature
of the thing, such as modes, circumstances, and relations.

Those partial conceptions we frame of the divine nature
are what we call the attributes of God: which, how diffe-
rent soever from one another in our thoughts, are all neces-
sarily included in the simple idea of God; and therefore
cannot be the ground of such a distinction as we are now
inquiring after. For when 1 say, that God is holy, wise, or
powerfuL I only say that explicitly and in part, which Ι
said implicitly and in full, when I pronounced the name of
God; and the meaning of such propositions is no more but
this, that a holy, wise, powerful Being, of all other infinite
perfections‚ is holy, wise, powerful, &Q All which persec-
tionS, though considered separately under different appear-
ances by our imperfect faculties‚ being really but one simple
idea, can be applied to but one *single person in the first
sense of the word person, as it signifies a particular intelli-
gent being, nature, or principle3 and that for the reasons
