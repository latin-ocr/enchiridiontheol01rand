422 DOCTRINE OF THE TRINITY AND

apostle saith, The invisible things of him from the creation
of the world are plainly seen, being understood by the
things which are made, even his eternal power and God-
head, Rom. i. 20. Was this argument of the apostle good
or not ?

P. No doubt it was.

Pr. Then the creation of the world is an invincible proof
of the true God.

P. What follows?

Pr. Then if the making of all things be attributed to
Christ, he must be true God: but this is plain in the New
T estament, in which the making of all things is as clearly
attributed to the Son, as it is to the Father; All things,
saith St. John, were by him, and without him was not any
thing made that was made, John i. 3. For by him were
all things created, saith St. Paul, that are in heaven, and
that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be
thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers‚· all
things were created by him, and jor him, Col. i. 16. Thou,
Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of‘ the earth,
and the heavens are the worlt· of* thy hands, Heb. i. 10.
Now compare these expressions with those wherein the cre-
ation is attributed to the Father3 the world is said to be
made by him, Rom. i. 203 that he hath created all things,
Rev. iv. 11; that of him, and jor him, and to him, are all
things, Rom. xi. 36. And let any impartial mind discern
the difference. Therefore we have as much reason from
scripture to believe Christ to be God, as we have from the
creation of things to believe a God.

P. But you do not take notice of the different expressions
in scripture, concerning the Father and the Son; All things
are said, to be of the Father, and by the Son, 1 Cor. viii. 6.
And that the Father created all things by Jesns Christ,
Eph. iii. 9. which proves no more, than that the Son was
God's instrument in the creation.

Pr. What do you mean by God's instrument in the
creation? Do you think one creature can create another?
How then can the creation prove an infinite power? If you
