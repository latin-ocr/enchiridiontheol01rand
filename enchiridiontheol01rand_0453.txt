TRANSUBSTANTIATION COMPARED. 439

cern the difference. For the reason why a body must be
divided from itself, being in several places, is, because it is
finite, and there being no penetration of dimensions in
bodies, the interposing of other bodies must needs divide
the same body in distant places3 but the reason why the
same divine nature may be in several persons is, because it
is infinite; and therefore nothing can bound or discon-
tinue it.

P. You have talked much of contradictions3 is there any
greater about transubstantiation, than that of eternal gene-
ration of the Son in the mystery of the Trinity? for, if it
be not proper generation, then you cannot infer from it,
that the Son is ‘ff the same substance with the Famem if it
be, thenit must be a proceeding from not being to being,
and so an eternal generatim is a contradiction.

Pr. It is a rule in common reason, that all attributes
must be understood according to the nature of the subjects.
And therefore, if the subject here spoken of be of such a
nature as to be uncapable of proceeding from not being to
being, then whatever is affirmed of it must be so understood
as not to destroy its nature. The term of generatim alone
is not, it may be, sufficient to prove the Son co—essential
with the Father, because it might have been used impro-
perly and metaphorically. But when, from the scripture, it
otherwise appears that the Son of God, being the IVord,
was in the beginning with God, and was God, John i. 1.
and we soon after find him called tlte only-begonem of the
Fatlzer, ver. 14. and tlte only-begotten Son, ver. 18. we have
reason to infer from hence his eternal generation: which
must not be understood in such a mean sense as is agreeable

to creatureS, but as it is consistent with the essential attri-
butes of God, of which necessary existence is one. So that
by eternal generation no more can be meant, than such an
emanation of the Son from the Father, as doth suppose
them to have the same nature and co-existence3 which is
best represented by the rays of the sun coming from the
fountain of light, if they were permanent, and not suc-
cesswe.
