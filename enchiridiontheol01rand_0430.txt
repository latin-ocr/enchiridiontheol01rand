416 DOCTRINE oF THE TRINITY AND

tooh· up stanes to cast at him. After this followed this ,
third conference, John x. and this runs again into the
same point, that he, being· a man, made himself God. And
these conferences were all public, in or near the temple,
and this last was in Solomon's porch, John x. 23. a place
of great resort, and near the place where the sanhedrim
sate, who were the judges in the case of blasphemy.
Now the force of my argument from hence lies in these
things: .

(1.) That Christ certainly knew, that the Jews did think
by this discourse that he 'made himselfequal with Gocl.

(2.) That if it were not true, it were notorious blasphe-
my, and so esteemed by the Jews.

(3.) That such a mistake ought to have been presentvly
corrected, and in the plainest manner, as we find it was
done by St. Paul, when the men of Lystra said, The gods
are come down to us in the likeness of'mevm for he ran in
presently among them, and said, We are men of like pae-
sioozs zw’th glou, Acts xiv. 11, 15. It is impossible for me
to think, that, if Christ had known himself to be a mere
man, he would have suffered the Jews to have run away
with such a mistake as this, without giving them the clear-
est and plainest information; whereas in all his answers he
vindicates himself, and endeavours rather to fasten those
impressions upon them, as appears by this conclusion of the
last conference, That με may know and believe, that the
Father 2⁹3 in me, ancl I in him. Doth this look like correct-
ing a dangerous mistake in the Jews? And is it not rather
a justification of that sense which they took his words in?
And in the first conference, John v. our Saviour is so far
from doing as St. Paul did, that he challenges divine ho-
nour as due to himself, that all men should honour the Son
as they honour the Father, ver. 23. From whence it fol-
lows, that Christ must be charged as one, who, being a mere
man, did affect divine honorii-3 or else, that, being God as
well as man, he lookcd on it as justly due to him. I pray
tell me what sense do your friends the Socinians make of
those words of St. Paul, Phil. ii. 6, 7. Who being ἄη the
