it for our love and esteem of devotion to him as the other
doth upon the most serious consideration of it?

sin. For that is 50 contrary to the way of our salvation by
J esus Christ, that what tends most to our hatred of it must
conduce most to our happiness; and therefore be most wor-
thgs of all aeeeptation. It is agreed on all hands, that
Christ did suffer very much both in his mind and in his
body. In his mind, when it is said, that he was troubles] ἐπ
