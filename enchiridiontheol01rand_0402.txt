388 BISHOP STILLINGFLEET

And after the strictest exainination of copies, those will

be found the best, which have that reading on which· our

¹ Tim. iii· translation is grounded: And without controversy great is
the mystery ofgodlinesm God was manglfhst in the flesh.
So that God's being manifest in the flesh is made a great

part of the mystery of Christianity.

But here arises a difficulty, which deserves to be consi-
dered; i. e. “ Is there were nothing in the Christian doc-

“ be understood. But those who have ever loved to deceive
“ and abuse the rest of the world, have been always fond of
“ the name of mysteries; and therefore all such things are
‘⁶ to be suspected, which come under that name. For, all
‘⁶ such points which will not bear examination‚ must be
‘⁶ wrapt up and reverenced under the name of mysteries,
