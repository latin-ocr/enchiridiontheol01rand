store. Moreouer by hys goyng vp are graunted vs the
giftes of the Holy Ghost: as Paule doth sufficiently wit-
nesse. Eph. iiii. The other commoditie, which we take by
the doinges of Christ, is: that Christe is set for an example
vnto vs, to frame our lyues thereafter. If Christe hath
bene deade: if he hath bene buryed for sin: he was so but
ones. lf he be risen agayne: if he be gone vppe to hea-
uen: he is but ones risen : but ones gone vp. From hens-
forth he dieth no more, but liueth with God: and reygneth
in cuerlasting continuaunce of glory. So if we be deade:
if we be buried to sin: howe shall we heareafter lyue in the

men, but wyth heauenly honour and spiritual in dede, most
fyt for vs that giue it, and hym that shall receyue it, euen
as he hathe honoured and doth honour hys Father. For he
that honoureth him honoreth also the Father‚ of whiche he
himself is a substantiall witnesse.

Master. The end of the world holi scripture calleth the
fulfyllynge and parformaunce of the kyngdome and mistel-y
of Christ, and the renewing of all thynges. For (saythe the
apostle Peter in his second epistle the third chapter) we
loke for a new heauen: and a new earth, according to the
promise of God: whearin dwelleth ryghteousnesse. And it
semeth reason that corruption, vnstedfaste chaunge‚ and
synne, whervnto the whole world is subiect, *should at
length haue an end¹ Now bi what way, and what fashion
