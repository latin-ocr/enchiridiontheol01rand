cause and last end of his creatures, and such acts as are
agreeable thereto.

Pr. Then proper divine worship doth suppose an esteem
of God as infinitely above his creatures3 and how then is it
possible for us to give the same worship to God, and to a
creature? For if the distance be infinite between God and
his creatures, and we must judge of things as they are, then
we must in our minds suppose a creature to be infinitely
distant from God; and if we do 50, how is it possible to
give the same divine worship in this sense to God, and to
any creature?

P. And what now would you infer from hence?

Pr. Do not you see already? viz. that God cannot be
supposed to allow divine worship to be given to Christ, if
he were a mere creature; and therefore since such divine
worship is required by the Christian doctrine, it follows,
that those expressions which speak of his being one with tlte
Father cannot be figuratively understood.

P. But where is it that such divine worship is required
to be given to Christ in scripture? For, according to my
principleS, the church is to set the bounds and measures of
divine worship, and to declare what worship is due to God;
what to Christ; what to saints and angels3 to men upon
earth; what to images, sacraments, &a And if we depart
from this rule, I know not where we shall fix.

Pr. I pray tell me, doth the difference between God and
his creatures depend on the will of the church?

P. No.

Pr. Is it then in the church's power to give that to a
creature which belongs only to God?

P. I think not.

what not? God or the church?

P. God himself, if he pleases.

Pr. Then our business is to search what his will and
pleasure is in this matter, by reading the scriptures, where-
in his will is contained: and there we find it. expresscd,
