prophets to be adored? Nay, has not God taken aparticular
care to preserve men from idolatry, by forbidding them to
worship him in or by any sensible representation? Did not
the apostles, who worshipped Christ, forbid others to wor-
ship men of like passions with themselves, Acts xiv. 15.
commanding them to direct all their devotions to the living
God, who made heaven and earth ,9 How then can we sup-
pose that Christ was only a mere man, or some other crea-
ture, and not rather believe that he had the fulness ofthe
Godhead dwelling in him bodily!

But here it is objected; how can God and man be unit·
ed? And to this I must fairly answer, that I cannot tell. I
have confessed already, in the account Ι have given of those
notions of unity and distinction, that I have not any just or
distinct conceptions of the union of spiritual beingS, either with
bodies or with one another: but this I will venture to say,
that I can as well conceive God and man together under one
idea, at one view, as Ι can conceive a soul and body so united.

All that I know of the union of the soul and body is, that
there is some intelligent power that makes use of the organs
of my body, and acts in conjunction with the motions there
produced. And Ι may as well consider God united to man,
when he so acts by the ministry and operation of man, that
the actions of God seem conveyed to us the same way as the
actions of one man are to another. Had those who upon some
occasions spake by the extraordinary assistance of a divine
power been constantly so directed, and assisted, how could
. they have distinguished the motions of their souls from the
impressions of God? And if they could not, why should not
we think such an extraordinary power as this as much united
to such men, as that common ordinary power we call the
30ch is to those bodies in which it acts and exerts itself ?

Some have been of opinion, that what we call the soul is
nothing else but a constant regular inspiration, or a deter-
minate concurrence of God Almighty with such and such
motions and capacities of matter: but whether this be so or
no, as most probably it is not, it seems to me very plain
fron] scripture, that such a power that we ascribe to God,
did as constantly and regularly act in and through Christ,
