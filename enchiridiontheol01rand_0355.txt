TO HIS CLERGY. 341

giving due reverence and religious regards, diminish no-
thing of admonition in these particulars, and the like,
though they object, that you speak for yomselves, and in
your own cases. For counsel is not the worse, but the bet-
ter, if it be profitable both to him that giveS, and to him
that takes it. Only do it in simplicity, and principally in—
tend the good of their souls. ¹

XXII. In taking accounts of the good lives of your-
selves or others, take your measures by the express words
of scripture3 and next to them estimate them by their pro-
portion and compliance with the public measures, with the
laws of the nation, ecclesiastical and civil, and by the rules
of fame, of public honesty, and good report3 and last of all
by their observation of the ordinances and exterior parts of
religion.

XXIII. Be not satisfied when you have done a good
work, unless you have also done it well3 and when you
have, then be careful that vain-glory, partiality, self-con-
ceit, or any other folly or indiscretion, snatcb it not out of
your hand, and cheat you of the reward.

XXIV. Be careful so to order yourself, that you fall not
into temptation and folly in the presence of any of your
charges; and especially that you fall not into chidings and
intemperate talkings, and sudden and violent expressions:
never be a party in clamours and scoldings, lest your call-
ing be useless, and your person contemptible: ever remem-
bering‚ that if you cheaply and lightly be engaged in such
low usages with any person, that person is likely to be lost
from all possibility of receiving much good from your mi-
nlstry.

III. The ναίω and measures of’government to be used by
minister-3 in their respective cures.

XXV. UsE no violence to any man, to bring him to
your opinion; but by the word of your proper ministry, by
demonstrations of the spirit, by rational discourses, by ex-
cellent examples‚ constrain them to come in; and for
other things they are to be permitted to their own liberty,
