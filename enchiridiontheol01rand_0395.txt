1 TIMOTHY i. 15.

This is a faitlzjs'ul sayz‘wg, ared worthy of all acceptation,
that Christ Jesus came into the world to Save sinners,-
Qf'whom I am chiqfi

IF these words were to be understood without any re-
striction or limitation‚ that Jesus Christ came into the world
to save sinners, they would* overthrow the great design of
the Gospel, and make its excellent precepts useless and in-
effectual. For, to what purpose should men be put upon
the severe practice of repentance‚ mortification‚ and a con-
tinued course of a holy life, if the mere being sinners did
sufficiently qualify them for salvation? This indeed would
be thought a doctrine wortlcy (ff all acceptation by the
greatest θέντων-3,· but it could not be a faitlgfid myfflg, be-
ing not agreeable either to the nature of God, or revelation
of his will by Christ JeSuS. But St. Paul speaks of such
sinners as himself had been; i. e. such as had been great
sinners, but had truly and sincerely repented, of* whom I
am σΙιίςβ What then? must we look on him as the stand-
ard and measure of such sinners whom J esus Christ came
to save? What will then become of all those who have
been sinners of a higher rank than ever he was? It's true,
in the verses before the text, he sets out his sins, as a hum-
ble penitent is wont to do, with the worst colours and
deepest aggravations, who roais* before α blasphemer ami a. Ver. ¹3·
