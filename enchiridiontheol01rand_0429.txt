TRANSUBSTANTIATION COMPARED. 415

Pr. How doth that appear? For ver. 30. it is said, that
the Jews took up stones to stone him: which shews, that
they looked on him as speaking blasphemy. But what
blasphemy was it for Christ to declare an unity of consent
between him and his Father3 which in truth is nothing but
doing his Father's will? Therefore it is plain, that the Jews
did apprehend more in those words of our Saviour. And
they explain themselves, ver. 33. what they understood by
them, because that thou, being a man, malcest thgyself God.
Which shews that they thought not an unity of consent,
but of nature, was meant.

P. But Christ's answer shews, that he speaks only of a
God by office, and not by nature, verss 34. Jesus answered
them, IS it not written in your law, Ι said, Ye are gods?

Pr. I pray go on, and see how Christ argues, ver. 35, 36.
If he called them gods, meto whom the word ‘ff God came,

said, I am the Son of God ,9

P. This only shews that Christ had greater reason to be
called God, but not that he was so by nature.

Pr. I pray go on still, ver. 37, 38. If I do rnot the worhs
ofmy Father, believe me rzot. But pf I do, though you be-
lieve not me, believe the works ‚· that με may know ared be-
lieve that the Father is in me, and I in him.

P. Is it not said elsewhere, that he that heepeth his eom-
mandments (lwelleth in him, and he in him .9 1 John iii. 24.
W ould you hence infer an unity of nature between Christ
and believers?

Pr. I do not lay the weight on the phrase, but as it is
the conclusion of the dispute between Christ and the Jews.
And it ought to be observed, that this was the end of the
third conference between Christ and the Jews upon this
argument. The first was John v. and then from Christ's
saying, The Father worketh hitherto, and I work, ver. 17.
the Jews inferred, ver. 18. that he made himself' equal

Befbre Abraham was, I am, ver. 58. And then the Jews·
