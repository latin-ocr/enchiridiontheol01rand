476 BISHOP GASTRELL

And what we are obliged from thence to believe when we
express our saith in this particular manner.

First then, as to these forms of expression, that God is
One and Three, &c it is to be observed, that these names,
Fatlzer, Son, and Holy Ghost, are applied to God in scrip-
ture in a different way from what any of his other names
are: for the other names of God signify only partial con-
ceptions of the divine nature, such as self-existence, power,
&c and are all contained within the same idea of God; and
so are indifferently used upon any occasion to express the
whole idea of God to which they belong, which is the same
under every denomination. These therefore cannot be the
foundation of any distinction in the Godhead: but F ather,
Son, and Holy Gkost, according to our way of conceiving
things, signify something extrinsecal and accessory to the
divine nature, as much as we know of the divine nature
by reason; the whole idea of God being conceived as full
and complete before the application of these terms3 and
though all of them are separately and together affirmed of
God, yet each of them in so peculiar a manner, that there
are several occasions where, when one of these terms is used
with relation to God, it would be improper to use either of
the other. From whence it follows, that these three names
of God, Fatlaer, Son, and Holgy Glzost, must denote a three-

is consistent with the unity and simplicity of the ,divine na-
ture. For each of these names includes the whole idea we
have of God, and something more; so far as they express
the nature of God, they all adequately and exactly signify
the same; it is the additional signification which makes all
the distinction betwixt them.

What particular kind or manner of distinction this is, is
not expressed in scripture; but since the church has thought
fit to assign a name for it, that of person seems to me as
proper and agreeable to the whole tenor and design of the
holy writings, as any other that could have been chosen for
that purpose. For Fatker, Son, and Holy (Most, whether
we consider the primitive sense and intention of the words,
the general and constant use of them, or the particular con-
