ΟΝ ΤΗΕ TRINITY. 481

been shewn, God acted in a wonderful* manner, was wor-
shipped and adored, and acknowledged in all his attributes;
and with whom he abideth in the fulness of power and glory
for ever: and, since his death and reception into heaven by
a plentiful effusion of spiritual graces and influences; by
which means a great many have embraced the gospel of
Christ, and become lzeirs of salvation, and more from
henceforth to the end of all things shall daily be added to
the clmrclz ‘ff God, be supported in tlzeflzz'tlz, and be made
partakers of tlte purchased inherz‘tance reserved in heaven
for those that are sanctified by the Spirit of God.

Now, with respect to this‘great design of saving man-

neration, love, and gratitude we are capable of expressing
for such an inestimable blessing; God has been pleased to

Thus when God is pleased to represent his love to man-
kind, in the highest image of nature; that of a Father sa-
crificing an only well-beloved Son, the exact transcript and
resemblance of himself, perfectly innocent, and obedient to
his will in all things, we are to believe that, by the suffir-
ings and death of Christ, God has given greater proofs of
his love towards us than any man is capable of doing to an-
other; and that such an action of an earthly parent sug-
gests the nearest and likest conception we can possibly
frame of what our heavenly Father has done for us; though

at the same time we must acknowledge it comes infinitely
