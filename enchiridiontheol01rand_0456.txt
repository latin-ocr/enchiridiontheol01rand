442 ’ DOCTRINE OF THE TRINITY AND

and not such which depends only on fancy and imagina-
tion3 from thence its signification was enlarged, not only
to things real, (in opposition to mere appearances, and
creatures of the mind,) but to such a thing which did sub-
sist of itself, and had not its subsistence in another, as acci-
dents had. So that an hypostasis was a real substance
which had subsistence in itself. But such are of two kinds,
as the Greek fathers observe. (1.) Such as are real sub-
stances in themselves, but yet are capable of being joined
with another to make up a person; thus the soul and body
have two different hypostases, and make up but one person
of a man. (2.) It is taken for a complete individual sub-
sistence, which is not joined with any other as a part; and
so hypostasis is the same with a person, which is nothing
else but a complete, intelligent, individua] hypostasis. And
in this sense there can be but one hypostasis in Christ, i. e.
one person, though there be two natureS.

P. But our divines say, that the human nature after the
union hath no hypostasis, it being swallowed up by the
divine.

Pr. I know they do; but if they mean that the human
nature, after the union, loses that subsistence which is pro-
per to the human nature, it is impossible for them to avoid
the Eutychian heresy, condemned by the council of Chal-
cedon3 but if they mean no more than that there is a true
nature, but no person, save only that which results from
both natures3 they then agree with the sense of the church,
which condemned the Eutychians. For as much as the
heresies of Nestorius and Eutyches differed in themselves,
they were both built on the same ground, viz. that there
could be no true nature, but there must be a person; and
that two natures could not make one person. From whence
Nestorius asserted there were two persons in Christ3 and
Eutyches denied that there were two natures.

P. What doth all this signify, but that the authority of
the church must determine whether there be two natures
or two persons in Christ?

Pr. It seems then, the whole business wherein the gene-
