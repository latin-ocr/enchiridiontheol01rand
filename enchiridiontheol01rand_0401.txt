ΟΝ SCRIPTURE MYSTERIES. 387

heard of the result of this conference in Solomon's porch,)
Jesus said unco him, Tlcou least said. St. Mark, more ex- Matt. xxvi.
pressly, Jesus said, I (zm. And this was the blasphemy for 64·
which they put him to death3 as appears by the evan-212rk m.
gelists. So that this ought to be a dispute only between Mark xiv.
Jews and Christians3 since it was the very point, for which ξῖζη, xxvi.
they condemned him to death. And in his last most divine ⁶⁶·
prayer, just before his suffering, he owns the glory which Luke xxii.
he had with the Father before the world had a being: Andjgfh xvii. 5·
now, 0 Father, glorffgs thou me with thre glot-gs which I had
with thee bqfore the world wate. Was this nothing but the
glory which God had designed to give him? This is so far
from being peculial· to Christ, that it is common to all whom
God designs to glorify; and takes away the distinction be-
tween the decree and the execution of it.

(2.) As to the aposdes, the reason we believe their tes-
timony is, that they were men of great sincerity and plain-
neSS, and of great zeal for the honour and glory of God.
And according to this character, let us* examine what they
say concerning Christ J esus.

He that was most conversam with him, and beloved by
him, and lived to see his divinity contested by some, and
denied by others, is most ample in setting it forth in his
admirable, sublime, and divine introduc-tion to his gospel:
which all the wit of mankind can never make tolerable sense
of, if they deny Christ's being the eternal Son of G0d3J0hni.1,2‚
and it is he that hath preserved those conferenccs with the ἃς·
Jews, wherein he asserts his own divinity.

St. Paul was a stranger to him while he lived; but at the
same time when he was so zealous to persuade the Gentiles
to the worship of God, and not of creatures, he calls him
God over all, blessedfhr evermore. And when he saith, that nom. ix. 5·
the eternal power and Godlzead are made known bys the cre· Rom. i. 20.
ation oftlze world, he attributes the creation of all things to eol. i. 16.
Christ, applying to him those words of the Psalmist, Thou, Heb. i. 2,
Lord, in the beginning least laid tlte foundation oftlze ear-tm ¹0·
and the heavens are the works ofthgy hands. Which can-

not be understood of any metaphorica] creation.
