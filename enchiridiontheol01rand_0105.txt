TRANSUBSTANTIATION. 91

yeares ago, a manne for thexeellencie of his learning so
highfie esteined in Christes ehurch, that he was counted and
was iudged the singuler teacher in his time of Christes reli-
gion, the confounder of heresies, the scolemaster of many
godly martyres, and an opener of the high misteries in serip-
ture; he writinge vpon the 15th Chapter of S. Mathewes
gospell, saieth thus.

But if any thing entre into the mouth, it goth awaie into
the belly, and is auoided into the draught, yea and that
meate which is santified by the word of God and praier,

transubstaneiation‚ *saied that this parte of Origene, was
but sette furth of late by Erasmus and therefore is to be
suspected.

But howe vaine this their aunswere is, it appeareth
plainely: For so maie all the good olde authours whiehe
laie in olde libraries, and are sette fourth of late, bee by
