420 DOCTRINE OF THE TRINITY AND Α

divine and human nature in Christ, when he saith, The
Word was made flesh.

P. But doth not the scripture in other places imply that
there is a subordination in Christ to the Father, which is
not consistent with such an equality of nature; see Heb. i.
8, 9. 1 Cor. viii. 4, 5. xv. 27, 28. Rev. iii. 12.

Pr. The first place is a proof for the divinity of Christ3
for the words are, But urzto the Son he saith, Thy throne,
O God, is jor ever and ever, &c It is true, in the next
verse it is said, with respect to his office, Therejbre God, even
thy God, hath anointed thee, &c. But we do not deny that
Christ was anointed as mediator, and in that respect God
was his God3 but doth this prove that he that is mediator
cannot have a divine nature in conjunction with the human?

The second place, I suppose, is mistaken, 1 Cor. viii. not
4 and 5, but 6 verse, But unto us there is but one God, the
Father, (ff whom are all things, and we in mm,- and one
Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are alt things, and we by him.
And this is one of the strongest holds of the Socinians. But
two considerations will take off the seeming force of it.

1. That the apostle, in his disputes with the Gentile ido-
laters, concerning whom he speaks, ver. 4, 5. doth utterly
deny any divinity in the beings they worshipped instead of
God, when he saith, An idol is nothing in the world, and
that there is none other God hutone. He knew very well
that they worshipped many, ver. 5. As there be gods many,
and lords many among them‚· but unto us (Christians) there
τέ· but one God, and one Lord: i. e. we have but one su-
preme God, to whom we give divine worship; and, instead
of the multitude of mediators, we have but one Mediator;
and so his design is in opposition to their many gods, to
assert the unity of the divine nature, (not so as to exclude
a distinction of persons, but thereby to exclude other gods
as the proper object of worship,) and the unity of a Medi-
ator, in opposition to their many lords.

(2.) That if this place excludes Christ from the unity of
nature with God, it doth exclude him from being the ob-
ject. of divine worship; for it saith, that there is no other
