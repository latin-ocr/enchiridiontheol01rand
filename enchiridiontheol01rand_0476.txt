they proceeded f1·01n; neither can any cooperation, οι·
consent of actions, make us conceive a spiritual union,
without conceiving the same term of action too. For sup-
pose two souls were so exactly framed ahke, that they al-
ways thought and willed the same things at the same times,
and were conscious of each other's thoughts and actions,
if they were put into different bodies, it is plain we could
not properly say they were united or made one: and again,
supposing they were in the same body, we could not possi-
bly conceive them to be two, any otherwise than we knew
them capable of a separate existence3 that is, if we examine
our thoughts honestly, of a seperate ubi, in different bodies,
or elsewhere: not that 1 think local presence, or determina-
tion, is any way contained within the idea of a spiritual
being, but it helps us to conceive it better, and discourse
more distinctly about it. And, if we observe it, there are
several cases where our conceptions and judgments must
necessarily differ.

These then are all the kinds of unity and distinction I
can possibly imagine; namely, in idea, principle, and posi-
tion. ·Whatever else is called unity is more properly termed
agreement ; the very notion of which implies a distinction in
some of the fore-mentioned kinds.

Identity is nothing else but a repetition of unity, as nze-m-
ber is of dg'ffereozce, with the judgment of the understanding
upon it.

What personat unity and distinction are, will be easily
understood by explaining the word person, which signifies
one of these two things, either a particular intelligent being,
or an office, character, or some such complex ‘notion applica-
ble to such a being. In the first sense, one man, or angel,
is one person, and several men or angels, are several per-
sons: in the second sense of the word, there may be so
many persons as there are different combinations of the
actions, relations, and circumstances of intelligent beings.

And thus having given an account of the meaning and
signification of the terms in which we are required to ex-
press 0111· saith, we arc next to examine, how far, and in
