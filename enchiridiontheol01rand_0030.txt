drynkyng with them. In whose syghte he was conueyed
away in a cloud, vp into heauen, or rather aboue al hea-
uens: wher he now sitteth at the ryght hand of God the
Father: being made Lorde of all thinges, be they in hea-
uen‚ or in earthe: kynge of all kynges: our euerlasting and
onlye hie bishoppe: our only attournye: only mediatour,
onelye peacemaker betwene God and men. Now sithens
that he is entred into his glorious maiestie, by sendynge
downe his holy Spirit vnto vs (as he promised) he lighten-
eth our dark blyndnesse: moueth, ruleth, teacheth, cleans-
eth, comforteth, and reioyseth our myndes: and so will he

Master. Well, I se thou hast touched the chiese articles

shoulde not be taken for the Sonne of God. For whyche
cause also, whyle he hong vpon the erosse, thei that sawe
hym vpbrayded hym and sayde: he hath saued other, but
cannot saue hym selfe: let hym now come downe from the
crosse, and we will beleue hym. But now vprising from
the dead to euerlasting continuaunce of life, he hathe shewed
a mutche greater power of hys Godheade, then if by com-

louse the bondes of death, and by his owne power to rise

againe, that properlye belongeth to J esus Christe the onlye
begotten Sonne of God, the only author of lyfe. Moreouer
