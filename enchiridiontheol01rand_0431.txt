TRANSUBSTANTIATION COMPARED. 417

Jbrm (ff God, thought z't ‘not robbery to be equal with God,

but made lcimseff'of'no reputation, &c
P. The sense they give is this, that he did not make a

show or ostentation of his own greatness, but studiously
concealed it, and therefore shewed his great humility.

Pr. But is there any greatness like that of divine ho-
nour? and yet this he challenged to himself.

P. But he knew what the Father designed him for, and
so spake those things by way of prediction.

Pr. He knew no creature could deserve divine worship,
and he delivered that as part of his own doctrine-3 and
therefore those words, where he is said to make himseffequal
with God, must be understood of nature, and not of office.

P. But St- John xvii. 22. saith, that Christ prayed to
his Father for his disciples, that they ‘may be one, as we are

one,· and that is not by unity of nature.
Pr. I grant it. But our Saviour there speaks of a true,

but a lower kind of unity3 or else the Socinians must think
every believer as capable of divine honour as Christ him-
self, if they take those words strictly, that they may be one

as we are one.
P. St. Paul saith, He that planteth and water-eth z'S one,

1 Cor. iii. 8.

Pr. Who doubts but there are other sorts of unities, be-
sides that of nature? But doth this prove that there is no
unity of nature between the Father and the Son? If we
have no better arguments against transubstantiation, we will
give over disputing.

P. I know you have other arguments for the Trinity, but
they prove as little without the authority of the church3 as
from those places where Christ is called God, as John i. 1, 2.
Rom. ix. 5, ὅτε. ’

Pr. And I think the argument from those places very
good and strong, especially from John i. 1, 2, 3. and it
seems directly contrary to the whole design of scripture, to
call any one God over all, blessedfhr evermore, as Christ is
called, Rom. ix. 5. but he that is God by nature.

P. How do you prove that John i. 1. relates to any thing
